      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Adonijah Bidwell (1716-1784) was born in Hartford, Connecticut in 1716 to Thomas and
        Prudence Bidwell. He attended Yale and graduated in 1740. In April of 1745 Bidwell joined
        the Connecticut Fleet during the early part of King George's War. He served as the chaplain
        aboard the sloop-of-war "The Colony" and participated in the capture of Cape Brenton. After
        the war, Bidwell returned to Hartford, Connecticut, and in 1750 settled in Tyringham (now
        Monterey), Massachusetts, as the first settled pastor. In 1752, Bidwell married Theodosia
        Colton, daughter of his Yale tutor Rev. Benjamin Coulton. Theodosia died in 1759. In 1760,
        Bidwell married Theodosia's first cousin, Jemima Devotion, with whom he had four children.
        She died in 1770. Bidwell married Ruth Kent in 1772. Bidwell supported independence from
        Britain and used the pulpit to surreptitiously advocate for this position prior the American
        War for Independence. Adonijah Bidwell died in 1784.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>This collection contains two booklets of sermon notes and scriptural references for sermons
        preached by Bidwell at Tyringham, Massachusetts. Sermons are dated with multiple years, most
        likely indicating that many sermons were preached multiple times. In some cases, it is
        difficult to infer the original date of creation versus a date of re-use. The booklets
        contain notes on their covers with dates and locational information, though it is difficult
        to determine if this is original or added at a later date by an unknown author.</p>
