      <p>The Pilgrim Congregational Church in Streamwood, Illinois, was formally gathered in 1959,
        though its people had been worshipping together since at least 1958. The church, in its
        initial form, may have been known as the Community Church. Rev. Philip Hubard Ward was the
        organizing minister. Through Ward, the church had a connection with the First Congregational
        Church in Elgin, Illinois. The church was a member of the United Church of Christ. It likely
        dissolved around 1971 or 1972.</p>
