      <abstract>The Warren Avenue Congregational Church in Chicago, Illinois, began as a mission
        branch church before being gathered as an independent church in 1889. The church building
        was constructed in 1886 and it underwent renovations and expansions in 1896 and 1901. The
        church merged with the Central Presbyterian Church to become the Warren Central United
        Church in 1968. After a merger with the Faith Presbyterian Church in 1977, the church became
        the Pine Avenue United Church. The church exists today as the Pine Avenue United Church
        Presbyterian. This collection contains membership and other vital records related to the
        Warren Avenue Congregational Church.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The Warren Avenue Congregational Church in Chicago, Illinois, began as a small branch
        mission of the First Congregational Church in the East Garfield Park neighborhood. The
        mission first founded a Sunday school in 1879 and then a branch church in 1880. A church
        building was constructed in 1886 at the modern corners of W Warren Boulevard and N. Albany
        Avenue. The Warren Avenue Congregational Church was formally gathered as an independent
        church in 1889. Rev. James A. Adams was the first minister of the independent church. In
        1896, the church building was enlarged. Additional renovations were completed in 1901.</p>
      <p>In 1934, the Monroe Street Federated Church, merged into the Warren Avenue Congregational
        Church. By the 1950s, due to demographic changes in the neighborhood, the church had a
        significant Spanish speaking population. The church was a member of the United Church of
        Christ after the denomination's formation. In 1968, the church merged with the Central
        Presbyterian Church to form the Warren Central United Church. In 1971, the Calvary
        Presbyterian Church merged into the church. In 1977, the church merged with the Faith
        Presbyterian Church to form the Pine Avenue United Church. The church exists today as the
        Pine Avenue United Church Presbyterian.</p>
