      <abstract>The Plymouth Congregational Church was formed in 1878 and the Union Congregational
        Church was formed in 1871. Construction on the Plymouth Church was completed in 1919. Both
        churches merged in 1927 to form the Plymouth-Union Congregational Church. Due to decreased
        membership, the church dissolved in 1971. The church building was transferred to the Holy
        Cross Church of God in Christ in 1971 and then to Iglesia Visión Evangélica in 2016. In
        2021, the church building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. This
        collection contains three folders of historical items related to the Plymouth-Union
        Congregational Church in Providence, Rhode Island, and its two predecessor churches, the
        Plymouth Congregational Church and the Union Congregational Church. The folders contain
        clippings, directories, photographs, and meeting minutes.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The Plymouth Congregational Church was formed in 1878, though a chapel for the community
        had been around since 1871. The first church building was constructed on Richardson Street,
        now Pennsylvania Avenue, in South Providence, Rhode Island. Construction on a new church
        building began in 1915 and was completed in 1919. The building was designed by George F.
        Newton of Boston. The church and building continued to serve the community until 1927 when
        the Plymouth Congregational Church and Union Congregational Church merged to form the
        Plymouth-Union Congregational Church.</p>
      <p>The Union Congregational Church was formed in 1871 with the merging of the Richmond Street
        and High Street Churches. Construction on a new church building for the Union Congregational
        Church on Broad Street was completed in 1872. By the 1920s, membership at the Union
        Congregational Church had declined significantly. By 1927, it was agreed that the Plymouth
        and Union Congregational Churches would merge to form the Plymouth-Union Congregational
        Church. The Union Congregational Church's building was sold in favor of keeping the Plymouth
        Church's building.</p>
      <p>In 1928, Dr. Samuel T. Clifton became the Plymouth-Union Congregational Church's first
        minister. In 1944, a stained-glass window designed by Hiemer &amp; Co. was installed in the
        south wall of the church building. J. Wesley Prince was installed as minister of the church
        in 1946. Membership in the church began to decline during the 1940s and continued to decline
        through the 50s and 60s, largely due to changes in the demographics of South Providence.
        During this time, the church building was shared with the Central Christian Church of
        Warwick and the South Baptist Church of Providence. J. Wesley Prince remained minister at
        the church until 1969. In 1971, the church was dissolved and the church building was
        transferred to the Rhode Island Conference of the United Church of Christ.</p>
      <p>The building was then transferred to the Holy Cross Church of God in Christ, an
        historically black congregation that had previously been firebombed at its previous location
        in Providence, on December 26, 1971. The Holy Cross Church of God in Christ closed in 2015
        and in 2016 the Plymouth Church building was transferred to Iglesia Visión Evangélica. The
        church building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in March 2021; the
        nomination was significant as the first bilingual nomination to be submitted to the
        NHRP.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>This collection contains three folders of historical items related to the Plymouth-Union
        Congregational Church in Providence, Rhode Island, and its two predecessor churches, the
        Plymouth Congregational Church and the Union Congregational Church. The titles of the
        folders were derived from titles created by Rev. J. Wesley Prince, however, the contents of
        the folders seem to include materials from potentially all three churches. It is likely that
        the contents of the folders were once kept in scrapbooks before their current arrangement.
        The folders contain worship bulletins, clippings, directories, financial records,
        photographs, meeting minutes, reports, mortgage documents, and anniversary brochures.</p>
