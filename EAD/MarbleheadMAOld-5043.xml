        Marblehead was established on August 13, 1684 and Rev. Samuel Cheever was ordained the first
        minister. The first meeting house was built atop Old Burial Hill in 1638 and the second
        meeting house was constructed 1695. The third, and final, meeting house, built of stone, was
        constructed in 1824. Disagreements over the appointment of ministers led to the
        establishment of the Second Church in 1716 and the Third Church in 1858. Now known as the
        Old North Church, the First Congregational Church in Marblehead continues to serve the local
        community. This collection contains both the records of the church and of the Congregational
        Society. Included in the collection are meeting minutes, membership lists, vital records,
        and financial records.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>While Marblehead, Massachusetts, was incorporated as a separate town in 1649, legally, the
        area was still under the direct governmental control of Salem long after incorporation. The
        result of arrangement was that congregants in Marblehead were required to travel to Salem in
        order to receive communion and other sacraments. Due in part to the difficulty of travel and
        in part due to the political turmoil following the 1684 revocation of the Massachusetts Bay
        colonial charter, the town of Marblehead took steps to become independent of Salem in 1864.
        Parallel to this effort was the establishment of the First Church of Christ of Marblehead on
        August 13, 1684 with Rev. Samuel Cheever, who had been preaching in Marblehead since 1668,
        as the first minister.</p>
      <p>The first meeting house was constructed in 1638 atop what is now known as Old Burial Hill.
        By 1695, the congregation had outgrown the dated structure. Construction on a new centrally
        located meeting house began in the early summer of 1695 and was completed before the year
        ended. Due to the success of the building fund drive, there were additional funds left after
        construction which were used to reuse materials from the old structure to construct a new
        schoolhouse.</p>
      <p>Rev. Cheever served as pastor of the church until, due to age and health concerns, it was
        decided by the town, in 1714, to bring a new minister to help Cheever and relieve him of his
        pastoral duties. By 1715, three candidates had been identified: John Barnard, Ames Cheever,
        Rev. Cheever's son, and Edward Holyoke. In 1715, the town voted to invite Barnard to be the
        new pastor and he was ordained in 1716. Rev. Cheever continued to preach and participate in
        the church until 1719. The ordination of Rev. Barnard also caused a rift in the congregation
        with a significant minority of the congregation strongly preferring Edward Holyoke.
        Following Barnard's ordination, 28 members requested dismission from the First Church in
        order to form the Second Congregational Church with Edward Holyoke as their minister. The
        Second Congregational Church now exists as the Unitarian Universalist Church of
        Marblehead.</p>
      <p>The First Congregational Church saw some expansion during the early nineteenth-century
        under the pastorate of Rev. Samuel Dana. In 1817 he helped to establish the church's Sunday
        school and in 1824, he oversaw the construction of a new stone church building. This
        building continues to serve as the church building today. Following a protracted dispute
        related to the installation of Rev. Benjamin R. Allen in 1854, 49 members requested
        dismission from the First Church in order to form the Third Church, known as the South
        Church, in 1858. Due to this separation, the First Church was renamed to Old North Church
        the same year. Following a catastrophic fire that destroyed the South Church building, many
        members of the South Church rejoined the Old North Church in 1877. In 1879 the Parish House
        was built beside the church and in 1886 the church underwent major renovations which
        included the rebuilding of the church front.</p>
      <p>The church continued to serve the community during the twentieth-century. During the 1950s
        and 1960s the church membership increased dramatically. In 1950 the Parish House was
        rebuilt. In 1964 the Old North Church joined the United Church of Christ. The church
        continues to serve the local community today.</p>
