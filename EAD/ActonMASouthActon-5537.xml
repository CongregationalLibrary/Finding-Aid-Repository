      <abstract>The South Acton Congregational Church in South Acton, MA began in 1876 as a chapel
        society founded by the Middlesex Union Conference of Congregational Churches and the
        Massachusetts Home Missionary Society. In 1877, a Sunday school was started with the Ladies
        Social Circle following in 1879. In 1891, the church voted to build a house of worship which
        was completed in 1893 along with the corporation of the South Acton Congregational Church.
        The church had various periods of renovations and renewal over the years but faced
        difficulties after 2020 leading to the close of the church in 2024 due to declining
        membership and finances. The church formally decommissioned in March 2025 with the
        congregation moving to the West Concord Union Church. This collection contains records of
        the South Acton Congregational Church's history, activities, administration, and members
        along with the chapel society, Sunday school, and Ladies Social Circle. The records include
        minutes, vital statistics, financial and legal records, building records, programs,
        correspondence, photographs, newsletters, newspapers, reports, plans, histories, and
        ledgers.</abstract>

      <p>The South Acton Congregational Church in South Acton, MA was started in June of 1876 by the
        Middlesex Union Conference of Congregational Churches and the Massachusetts Home Missionary
        Society as a chapel society. Meetings were held in the chapel in Dwight's Block before they
        moved to the schoolhouse in 1877. In 1877, the church started a Sunday school with the first
        classes in October. In February 1879, the ladies of the chapel society formed the Ladies
        Social Circle which was the first of the church's various women's groups that later included
        the Congregational Junior Guild and the Faholo Circle of King's Daughters. In 1886, the
        chapel society served ties with the Middlesex Union Conference and Missionary Society in an
        effort to be self-supporting. Throughout the 1880s and 1890s and various times in the 20th
        century, the church shared pastors and services with neighboring congregations including
        West Acton Baptist Church, Acton Center Congregational Church, and South Acton Universalist
        Church. There were discussions about federating and joining the South Acton Universalist at
        various points, but those efforts failed likely due to each church wanting to remain in
        their own building. In July 1891, the church voted to build a house of worship to
        accommodate their members with construction beginning in 1892 and ending with a dedication
        and transfer of land ownership in 1893. Also in July of 1893, the church officially and
        legally incorporated as the South Acton Congregational Church.</p>
      <p>In the 1960s, the church experienced a period of renewal with a parsonage purchased in
        1960, renovations and large maintenance projects in 1962 and 1963, and a renovation in 1966
        of the cellar from a maze of underused rooms into a space suitable for the Sunday school and
        other functions. In 1978, the parsonage was added on to and renovated. Also in the 1970s,
        the SACC Movers, later the Mission Movers, began as one of the longest of the church's many
        outreach and service efforts that characterize much of the history of the church. In late
        2000, the "Room to Bloom" campaign was completed with renovations of multiple rooms
        including the fellowship hall, offices, and classrooms. Another campaign, "Blessed and
        Blooming", was completed in 2006 with more renovations focused on accessibility in the
        kitchen, the chancel, and new floors. Entering the 2020s, the Covid pandemic brought
        difficulties to the church that it struggled to overcome and ultimately resulted in the
        church deciding to close in 2024 due to declining membership and finances. In December 2024,
        the last services were held before the majority of the congregation moved to the West
        Concord Union Church in West Concord, MA. The church was formally decommissioned March 2025,
        and the building sold in May 2025.</p>
