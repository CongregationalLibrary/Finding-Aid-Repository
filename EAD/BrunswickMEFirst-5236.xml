        incorporated on May 3, 1717. Until 1747 the town was served by temporary missionary
        ministers. In 1747 the First Parish Church was actually split into two buildings, one
        following Congregational polity and the other following Presbyterian polity. In 1772 both
        groups agreed to follow Congregational polity and in 1808 both groups physically merged into
        a single meeting house. The church had close relations to Bowdoin College and Harriet
        Beecher Stowe found inspiration for Uncle Tom's Cabin while attending the church. The
        Church, now a member of the UCC, continues to serve the community. The collection includes
        the early administrative and vital membership records of the church including church and
        parish meeting minutes, vital statistics of members, and ministerial records for Asa
        Mead.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The township of Brunswick was incorporated on May 3, 1717. The Massachusetts General Court
        voted to allocate funds for the dispatching of missionaries to the Native Americans still
        settled in Brunswick, an act which established the First Parish Church in Brunswick. The
        first missionary to visit was Rev. Joseph Baxter. He was followed by Rev. James Woodslide, a
        Brunswick local, who was deemed not puritanical enough to continue preaching. The first
        permanently settled minister of the First Parish Church was Rev. Robert Dunlap, a
        Presbyterian, who served as the pastor of the church from 1747-1760.</p>
      <p>Funding for the first meeting house was first authorized on January 9, 1717, but the
        building was not completed until 1735. This meeting house, in the western part of the town,
        was largely Presbyterian. A second meeting house was constructed in the eastern part of the
        town in 1756 and was largely Congregational. The minister of the First Parish served as
        pastor of both churches. In 1772, the two church populations agreed to officially follow
        Congregational polity. In 1790 some parishioners withdrew from the church in order to form a
        Baptist Society, in part because they did not wish to pay taxes to the town to support the
        Congregational minister.</p>
      <p>Construction on the third meeting house began in 1806 and was completed in 1808. At that
        point, the two church communities largely combined and met jointly in the third meeting
        house. The first meeting house became property of Brunswick until it was destroyed by fire
        in 1834. The second meeting house was largely abandoned after 1808 and was demolished by
        1835. The fourth, and final, meeting house, designed by Richard Upjohn, was dedicated on
        March 18, 1846. Harriet Beecher Stowe sat in pew 23 in this building in 1851 when she was
        inspired to write "Uncle Tom's Cabin."</p>
      <p>The First Parish Church had a close relationship with Bowdoin College during the 19th and
        20th century. The college provided some of the funds needed for the construction of the
        third and fourth meeting houses and Baccalaureate Services and Commencement Exercises were
        held annually at the church building until 1966.</p>
      <p>In 1960, the First Parish Church in Brunswick voted to join the United Church of Christ.
        The church continues to serve the community today.</p>
