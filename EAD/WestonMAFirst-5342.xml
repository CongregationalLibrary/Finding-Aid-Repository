      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>In 1698, the area of Watertown that would later be named Weston, was set off as the
        "Farmers' Precinct" based around the newly established Church of Christ. By 1700 a meeting
        house had been constructed and finally in 1709 Rev. Joseph Mors was ordained as the first
        minister of the church. In 1713 the "Farmers' Precinct" was established as the town of
        Weston.</p>
      <p>The first four ministers of the church were considered progressive and by the 1830s the
        theology of the church was beginning to shift towards Unitarianism. Unlike many
        Congregational churches during the 1830s, this gradual shift did not lead to a significant
        rift within the church community or the creation of an opposing Evangelical Congregational
        church. The shift towards Unitarianism was made official with the adoption of the 1867
        church covenant which also renamed the church to the First Congregational (Unitarian) Church
        in Weston. The name changed again in 1991 to The First Parish Church in Weston. The First
        Parish Church in Weston remains active today and is a member of the Unitarian Universalist
        Association.</p>

          <p>This volume contains the manuscript writings of Edmund Hamilton Sears from his time at
            the Harvard Divinity School. The volume contains an autobiographical sketch of Edmund
            Sears, a section on recollections and thoughts, poetry, some of which is pointedly
            political and/or anti-slavery, hymns, including a Christmas hymn, and a genealogy of the
            Sears family. There are portions of the manuscript which have been deliberately removed
            from the volume resulting in significant gaps.</p>
