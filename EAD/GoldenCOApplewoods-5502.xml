      <abstract>The establishment date for the United Church of the Applewoods in Golden, Colorado,
        is unknown, though it existed in the late 1950s. In 1968, the church agreed to share the
        building with the Jefferson Unitarian Church and in 1973 the church building was given
        completely to the Unitarian Church, likely marking the formal dissolution of the United
        Church of the Applewoods. The collection contains a single ledger containing both vital
        records and membership records for the church.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The establishment date for the United Church of the Applewoods in Golden, Colorado, is
        unknown. The church building was likely designed by Roger J. Easton and constructed in 1963,
        though a version of the church building may have been constructed in the late 1950s. In
        1968, the church entered into an arrangement with the Jefferson Unitarian Church to share
        facilities. In 1973, the Jefferson Unitarian Church took over control of the property. It is
        likely that the United Church of the Applewoods dissolved between 1971 and 1973. The
        Jefferson Unitarian Church continues to serve the Golden community today and continues to
        worship in the same building.</p>
