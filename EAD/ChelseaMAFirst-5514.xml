      <abstract>The First Congregational Church in Chelsea began as the Winnisimmet Congregational
        Church in Chelsea, MA in 1841 with Rev. Isaac P. Langworthy as pastor. In 1851, the church
        split into the Broadway Congregational Church which renamed itself as the Central
        Congregational Church in 1871, and the Winnisimmet Congregational Church which built a new
        edifice on Chestnut St in 1852. In 1874, the Winnisimmet Church changed its name to the
        First Congregational Church and in 1877, a group split off to form the Third Congregational
        Church in Chelsea. In 1905, the First and Third Churches united to become the First
        Congregational Church in Chelsea and built a new building on County Rd in 1906. In 1946, the
        Central Church closed and remerged with First Church. After declining membership and funds
        in the 2000s, the church sold the County Rd building to the city of Chelsea, but the members
        of the church remain active in the community even without their own building. This
        collection depicts the administration, history, and activities of the First Congregational
        Church in Chelsea with the records containing programs, annual reports, financial records,
        member records, committee minutes and records, correspondence, pastoral records,
        photographs, pamphlets, ledgers, and blueprints.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The First Congregational Church in Chelsea, MA began as the Winnisimmet Congregational
        Church in 1841 with a sabbath school, ladies benevolent society, and ordination of its first
        pastor, Isaac P. Langworthy being organized in the same year. The church grew rapidly in its
        first decade to the point that it decided to colonize itself with Rev. Langworthy, a group
        of members, the church records, and the name moving to a new building in 1851 while the
        remaining members became the Broadway Congregational Church. The Broadway Church later
        changed its name to the Central Congregational Church in Chelsea, MA in 1871. The members
        that moved and remained as part of the Winnisimmet Church built the Chestnut St edifice in
        1852 with the dedication in May 1852. In 1857, some members split from the church to form
        the Plymouth Congregational Church which only lasted until 1859. In 1858, the second pastor,
        Rev. Albert H. Plumb took over the pulpit from Rev. Langworthy. In 1874, the name of the
        church changed to First Congregational Church in Chelsea, but it was often still known
        colloquially as the Chestnut St church. In 1877, another group of members left to form the
        Third Congregational Church in Chelsea. However, changing populations and resources needed
        to support their respective congregations caused the First and Third Churches to work
        closely together after 1900 until they decided to officially unite in 1905 as one church
        under the name First Congregational Church in Chelsea with services continuing in Third
        Church's Reynolds Ave building. The last services in First Church's Chestnut St building
        were held in June 1905 before the building was sold. In 1906, the first pastor of the united
        church, Rev. Charles N. Thorp, was called and a new church was built on County Rd with a
        dedication in 1907 to accommodate the growing membership.</p>
      <p>In 1946, the Central Congregational Church in Chelsea closed with many of its members and a
        large portion of its funds going to the First Congregational Church. In 1961, the church
        voted to join the United Church of Christ. As the 20th century continued, the church grew
        and changed according to the changes in the Chelsea community before seeing a decline in
        membership and funds in the beginning of the 21st century. In 2024, the church sold the
        County Rd building to the city of Chelsea for use by the school district. The current status
        of the church is ambiguous given the lack of building for regular services and activities,
        but the members remain active in the Chelsea community.</p>
