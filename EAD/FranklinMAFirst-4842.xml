      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>Against the backdrop of the First Great Awakening, twenty-four members from the Second
        Precinct of Wrentham split from the First Church and signed the covenant which became the
        founding document for the Second Church of Wrentham, also known as the West Parish Church,
        in 1738. Not long after, the call went out to Rev. Elias Haven to become the first pastor of
        the new church. He accepted and was ordained on November 8, 1738. The first meeting house
        was constructed in the summer of 1739. It was a simple structure which included no pews
        except for the two which had been constructed at the expense of the pew owners. By 1772 the
        church's membership had outgrown the first meeting house and the search for a new location
        was begun. However, disagreements within the church community, and difficulty with the town,
        long delayed the purchase of new land and construction.</p>
      <p>In 1778, the West Precinct of Wrentham separated from Wrentham and was incorporated as
        Franklin in honor of Benjamin Franklin. It had been hoped that Benjamin Franklin would
        donate a bell for a church steeple, but instead he donated 116 books which became part of
        the Franklin Public Library's initial collection. At the same time as the town of Franklin
        was incorporated, the West Parish Church was renamed the First Congregational Church of
        Franklin. Construction on the second meeting house did not begin until 1787 and was
        completed in 1789. In 1806 a belfry was constructed and the first bell was installed. In
        1827, a formal Sunday School was founded and attached to the church. Due to the growth of
        the town of Franklin after the Civil War, a third meeting house was found necessary and
        construction completed on it in 1872. The fourth and final church building was constructed
        in 1895. Throughout the nineteenth-century, the church actively participated in benevolent
        societies and several members of the church participated in both foreign and home mission
        societies.</p>
      <p>Franklin was not spared from the Great New England Hurricane of 1938 and during the storm
        the church building for the First Baptist Church of Franklin, established in 1868, was
        destroyed. The First Congregational Church invited the Baptists to use their building for
        worship. In 1941, the two congregations reformed together to form the Franklin Federated
        Church.</p>
      <p>The Franklin Federated Church, which is associated both with the United Church of Christ
        and the American Baptist Church, continues to serve the Franklin community today.</p>
