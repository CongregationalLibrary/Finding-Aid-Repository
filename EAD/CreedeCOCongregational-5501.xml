      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The history of Creede, Colorado, as a town, begins between 1889 and 1891 when the discovery
        of rich mineral deposits resulted in the settlement's population increasing from 600 to more
        than 10,000. In 1892, the town of Creede was incorporated. Rev. Horace Sanderson, a
        missionary minister from the Congregational Home Missions office, delivered the first sermon
        in town on January 10, 1892. Almost a year later, the first baptism was recorded on November
        20, 1892, by Rev. Milton M. Frantz. On June 10, 1893, Rev. William T. Patchell preached his
        first sermon. Under Patchell, the church was formally incorporated on August 5, 1894.</p>
      <p>The first cornerstone for the first church building was laid on May 30, 1905. The sanctuary
        was in use by the following winter and the dedication service for the church building was
        held on June 30, 1912. "The Red Church" building has been the Creede Congregational Church's
        sole church building. The Creede Congregational Church, now known as the Creede Community
        Church, is a member of the United Church of Christ and continues to serve the community
        today.</p>
