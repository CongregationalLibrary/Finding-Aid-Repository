      <abstract>The First Congregational Church of Brookfield, Illinois, was formally gathered on
        November 25th, 1894. Construction on the church building was completed in 1897. The building
        underwent renovations in 1907, 1919, 1938, and again in 1947. The church was expanded in
        1955 to support the Sunday school and create community focused spaces. The church joined
        with the United Church of Christ in the early 1960s. The church dissolved in 2013; the
        church building continues to function as a church today. This collection contains records
        related to the administration and membership of the First Congregational Church. The
        collection also contains records from auxiliary groups, especially from the Women's
        Fellowship, as well as contains membership records, including membership lists and
        directories, and vital records.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The village of Grossdale, Illinois, was first settled in 1889 with the sale of lots by real
        estate investor Samuel Eberly Gross. The First Congregational Church was formally gathered
        on November 25th, 1894. Rev. J. C. Meyers became the first minister of the church in 1895;
        he was quickly proceeded by Rev. George H. Grannis in 1896. That same year, plans for the
        construction of a church building were put into motion. Construction on the church building
        began in March, 1897, and the dedication service for the new building was held a few months
        later on May 23. The village of Grossdale changed its name to Brookfield in 1905. The church
        building, with support from congregations in La Grange, Western Springs, and Hinsdale,
        underwent significant repair work in 1907 to fix the building's foundation and heating
        plant.</p>
      <p>During World War I, the Men's Club presented speakers on topics related to the war effort.
        In 1919, the church underwent renovations to once again repair the furnace; the effort was
        supported by "Furnace Parties" which raised part of the cost of the renovation. A plan to
        merge with the Methodists in Brookfield was considered around 1920 but ultimately did not
        come to pass. In 1922, the church purchased a house adjacent to the church building to be
        used as a parsonage. Additional plots of land were purchased in 1927 to support a
        significant expansion of the church's facilities but this expansion never came to pass.</p>
      <p>In 1938, the church building underwent some remodeling to support the purchase of a pipe
        organ in hopes that the organ music would refresh and improve worship services. Following
        the purchase and installation of the organ, the church underwent additional renovations to
        raise the church, create a recreational center, and redecorate both the interior and
        exterior of the church. 1938 also saw the formation of the church's Friendship Club. In
        1943, the Ladies Aid Society and the Amafeurasia, a missionary group, merged to form the
        church's Women's Fellowship. During World War II, the church's Social Action Committee
        published a the "Bits o' News" newsletter which facilitated connections between the parish
        and those from the church serving during the war.</p>
      <p>Another significant renovation took place in 1947, this time with the purpose of making the
        building "the most useful and architecturally beautiful building in Brookfield." This once
        again saw the building's exterior redone and the interior refurbished. The plan to expand
        the church was revisited again in 1955 with a proposal to build a new parsonage, remove the
        old parsonage, and build a new wing of the church dedicated to the Sunday School which was
        facing significant crowding issues. Unlike the 1927 plan, these expansions came to
        fruition.</p>
      <p>The church continued to serve the Brookfield community in the decades after. It joined the
        United Church of Christ in the early 1960s. The church dissolved in 2013 with its final
        service held on May 19th. The Women's Fellowship continued to exist alongside the church
        until the church's dissolution. The church building was sold and continues to function as a
        church today.</p>
