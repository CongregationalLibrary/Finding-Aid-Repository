        Society were formed in the Pottersville, Somerset area as early as 1838 by a "Christian
        Band" comprising thirty members, though the church was not officially incorporated until
        1911. In 1939 the name was changed to the Congregational Christian Church of Somerset
        Centre. These records consists of three bound volumes, including the earliest record books
        of the church and society, respectively, and a book of meeting minutes and bylaws of the
        Ladies' Industrial Association.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>In 1838, a group of thirty, known as the "Christian Band", signed a covenant to organize a
        church community in the village of Pottersville in Somerset, Massachusetts. The covenant
        led, in November 1840, to the construction of a meetinghouse. On May 26, 1841, a ceremony
        was held for the dedication of the new meetinghouse and its acceptance into the Christian
        denomination. Later that year William Shurtleff was called to be the first pastor of the
        religious society known as the First Christian Union Society in Somerset, Massachusetts.</p>
      <p>It was not until 1911 that the First Christian Church, as it came to be known, was
        incorporated under the laws of Massachusetts. In 1939, a vote was taken to change the name
        to the Congregational Christian Church of Somerset Centre. The church is still active today
        as the Congregational Christian Church of Somerset and has been a member of the United
        Church of Christ since 1957.</p>
