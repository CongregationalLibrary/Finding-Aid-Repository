      <abstract id="aspace_43cbf18c2d3e02bcc540ac0c4d3e0d4b">The town of Newbury, Massachusetts, was
        first settled in 1635. The First Church was gathered in 1635 and construction on the first
        meeting house was completed the same year. In 1743 a group of parishioners left to form the
        First Episcopal Church. Between 1635 and 1806 five meeting houses were constructed. The
        fifth was destroyed in fire in 1868. The sixth, and final, meeting house was constructed in
        1869. The First Church joined the United Church of Christ in 1961 and in 1967 the church was
        renamed to the First Parish Church in Newbury; this church continues to serve the Newbury
        community today. This collection contains a manuscript reproduction, created by Joshua
        Coffin in 1853, of an ecclesiastical council determination called in 1669 and 1670 to advise
        the parish church on questions of governance.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The town of Newbury, Massachusetts, was first settled in 1635. The early European colonists
        settled along the Wessacu√ßon River, also transcribed as Quascacunquen; the river is now
        known as the Parker River. The First Church in Newbury was formally gathered in 1635 and was
        the twelfth church to be established in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The first meeting
        house was also constructed in 1635. As the Newbury settlement began to expand north towards
        the Merrimac River the Parish decided to build a more central church. This second meeting
        house was constructed in 1647. In 1661 the third meeting house was constructed across from
        the second to accommodate a larger parish. The fourth meeting house was erected in 1699.</p>
      <p>Three distinct population centers formed in Newbury during the late seventeenth-century. In
        1694 the western portion of Newbury was partitioned into the West Parish and the Second
        Church in Newbury was formed. Another partition took place in 1722 with the creation of the
        Newburyport Parish and gathering of the Third Church in Newbury. Both parishes were
        eventually incorporated as the towns of West Newbury and Newburyport.</p>
      <p>In 1743 a group of parishioners, unhappy with Rev. Christopher Toppan and eager to more
        closely follow the teachings of George Whitefield, withdrew from the First Church. They
        later formed the First Episcopal Church along with a group of parishioners who had also
        withdrawn from the Third Church to better follow George Whitefield's teachings.</p>
      <p>The fifth meeting house was constructed in 1806 and dedicated on September 17, 1806. During
        the nineteenth-century the parish community participated in numerous reform movements. In
        1818 a Sunday school was opened. The following year the Female Reading Society was formed.
        The fifth meeting house was destroyed in a fire on January 26, 1868. Construction on the
        sixth, and final, meeting house was completed in 1869.</p>
      <p>In 1961 the church voted to join the United Church of Christ. In 1967 the parish and church
        organizations were merged and the name of the church was changed to First Parish Church of
        Newbury. The First Parish Church continues to serve the Newbury community today.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>This collection contains a manuscript reproduction of an ecclesiastical council declaration
        called in 1669 and 1670. The original was made in the hand of Rev. John Woodbridge and the
        copy was produced by Joshua Coffin in 1853. The council was called to advise the Newbury
        church on a proposal to change their church governance from a Council of Elders to a more
        democratic system. The response of the council was overwhelmingly negative; they claimed
        that such a process was against the Congregational way and promoted popery. Despite this, by
        1683, Newbury First had no ruling elders.</p>
