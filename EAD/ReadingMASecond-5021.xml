        was gathered on June 29, 1720 with 39 founding members. The first pastor was Rev. Daniel
        Putnam who served until his death on June 20, 1759. He was followed by Rev. Eliab Stone who
        became the pastor in 1761 and also served until his death in 1822. Religious disagreements
        led to a split during the 1830s and in 1892 the Congregationalists and Methodists merged to
        form the Union Congregational Church of North Reading, which continues to serve the
        community today. The record book contains vital statistics, meeting minutes, and
        disciplinary records.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The town of Reading was originally settled in 1639 as an offshoot of nearby Lynn, and
        incorporated as a town of its own in 1644 with a church gathered the following year. By
        1713, the northern part of the town had grown large enough that its residents successfully
        petitioned to become a separate precinct encompassing the area north of the Ipswich River.
        The first meeting-house was constructed in 1717 and the Second Church of Christ in Reading
        was gathered on June 29, 1720 with 39 founding members. A call to serve was extended to the
        Rev. Daniel Putnam, a Harvard Graduate who, at 23, accepted the call. He served as pastor
        until his death on June 20, 1759.</p>
      <p>A second meeting house was constructed on the site of the first in 1752. In 1761, Rev.
        Eliab Stone, another Harvard graduate, was given the opportunity to become the pastor of the
        North Parish. He too served until his death in 1822. The third meeting house was constructed
        in 1829.</p>
      <p>Religious turmoil reached the North Parish during the 1830s in the form of increasing
        disagreements between the Orthodox and Universalist traditions. In 1836, the Orthodox
        members of the church withdrew and constructed a new church. This split was one of many
        within the greater Reading community at the time. Beginning around 1875, the Methodist
        Church in North Reading began meeting on the second floor of the Second Parish's meeting
        house. In 1892, the two parishes merged to form the Union Congregational Church of North
        Reading.</p>
      <p>On July 16, 1923, the church was officially incorporated and the bodies of the church and
        society were merged into one organization. The Union Church voted to join the United Church
        of Christ during the earlier part of the 1960s. The church continues to serve the community
        today as the North Reading Union Congregational Church.</p>
