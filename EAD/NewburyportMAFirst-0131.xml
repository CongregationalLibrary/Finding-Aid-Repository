        formally gathered in 1726. In 1743 a group of parishioners left the church to more closely
        follow the teachings of George Whitefield and form the First Presbyterian Church. In 1764
        the town of Newburyport was incorporated and the Third Church became the First Church in
        Newburyport. In 1794 the Parish voted to be incorporated as the First Religious Society. By
        1825 the church was already aligned with the Unitarian denomination. The church continues to
        serve the Newburyport community today. The collection includes correspondence and letters of
        dismission related to the 1743 withdrawal of members.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The town of Newbury, Massachusetts, by the eighteenth century, had three major population
        centers. The first, in Oldtown, was settled along the Wessacu√ßon River (also transcribed as
        Quascacunquen and now known as the Parker River) in 1635. Later, a second population center
        began to form in the western half of Newbury (now West Newbury) which resulted in the
        formation of the Second Parish in 1694. Another population center formed along the southern
        bank of the Merrimac River in Newtown, also known as the Port. Unlike agrarian Oldtown,
        Newtown was largely a commercial center focused on shipping and trading. This economic
        difference ultimately resulted in the formation of the Third Parish in 1722. The Third
        Parish Society was formed in 1725 and the Third Church was formally gathered on January 2,
        1726. Construction on the first meeting house was completed in 1725.</p>
      <p>After preaching at the new meeting house as an interim minister, John Lowell was formally
        invited to become the first pastor of the Third Church in Newbury. He was ordained on
        January 19, 1726. In 1737 the meeting house was enlarged to accommodate the Port's growing
        population. In 1740, Rev. Lowell invited George Whitefield to preach a sermon at the meeting
        house; after the sermon over 140 new communicants were added to the parish registry. Some of
        those new communicants left in 1743 when 38 men left the Third Church, unhappy with Rev.
        Lowell's more liberal teachings, to more closely follow George Whitefield's teachings and
        gather their own church; they formed the First Presbyterian Church (now known as the Old
        South Presbyterian Church) in 1746. In 1764 the Third Parish of Newbury was officially
        incorporated as the separate town of Newburyport. At that time the name of the church
        changed to First Church. Rev. Lowell continued to preach at Newburyport until his death in
        1767.</p>
      <p>In 1794 the parish and church voted to incorporate as the First Religious Society in
        Newburyport. In 1798 the church began the process of selling the first meeting house and
        finding land for the construction of new meeting house. A location on Pleasant Street was
        chosen and the second meeting house was dedicated on October 2, 1801. A community Sunday
        school was formed in 1817; in 1824 the First Religious Society established its own Sunday
        school after some parishioners felt dissatisfied with the community school.</p>
      <p>By 1825 the church was considered to be affiliated with the Unitarian denomination. The
        Reverends Thomas Fox (pastor 1831-1846) and Thomas Wentworth Higgins (pastor 1847-1849)
        continued to push for church reforms. Both pastorates were notable for doctrinal and
        political differences which caused tumult within the parish community. Rev. Higgins resigned
        after two years due to the parish's hostility towards his strongly held abolitionist views.
        During the 1880s the second meeting house was repaired and restored.</p>
      <p>The First Religious Society continues to serve the Newburyport community today as a
        Unitarian Universalist Unitarian Church. The 1801 meeting house continues to serve as the
        church building; it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976 and
        included in the Newburyport Historic District in 1984.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>This collection contains correspondence and formal letters of withdrawal related to a group
        of parishioners in the Third Church in Newbury, Massachusetts, desiring to leave the parish
        in 1743 to form a new Presbyterian church. Most of the materials are either addressed to
        Rev. John Lowell or written by Rev. Lowell. Two of Lowell's letters, one in response to the
        initial withdrawal request and the other to a call for a church meeting, are pamphlet length
        and were intended for public reading and publication.</p>
