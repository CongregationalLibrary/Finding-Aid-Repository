        established in 1643 with Rev. Samuel Newman as the first minister. The first meeting house
        was constructed in 1646. The second meeting house was completed in 1678 after being delayed
        due to King Phillip's War. The third meeting house was constructed in 1718. The fourth, and
        final, meeting house was completed in 1810. In 1812 the western precinct of Rehoboth became
        the town of Seekonk. In 1862 the town of Seekonk was further divided and the church became a
        part of East Providence, Rhode Island. In 1886 the church was renamed to Newman
        Congregational Church. The church continues to serve the East Providence community today.
        This collection contains a 1785 draft of the articles of faith for the First Church in
        Rehoboth that were approved by Rev. John Ellis.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The town of Rehoboth, Massachusetts, was settled as early as 1636 and was officially
        established in 1643. The town included what is now Seekonk, Massachusetts, and East
        Providence, Rhode Island. The First Church in Rehoboth was established in 1643 with Rev.
        Samuel Newman as the minister. Newman, born in England, immigrated to the Massachusetts Bay
        Colony to escape persecution for his nonconformist beliefs. He settled in Dorchester until
        eventually he was called to become the sole minister of the Church at Weymouth after the
        church had, for a short while, three concurrent ministers. In 1643, Rev. Newman resigned
        from the position in large part because of dissention in the parish due to the continued
        residence of the three previous ministers in Weymouth. He left Weymouth to settle in western
        Rehoboth with some of his former parishioners. Rev. Newman served the First Church until his
        death on July 5, 1663.</p>
      <p>The first meeting house was constructed in 1646. In 1674 construction began on the second
        meeting house. The onset of King Phillip's War in 1675 however delayed construction. Much of
        the town was burned in 1676, though the original meeting house was preserved. In 1678
        construction on the second meeting house was resumed and by the following year the parish
        had moved into the new building. In 1713 the eastern portion of Rehoboth was set aside as
        its own parish where the Second Church was established. The First Parish remained in Seekonk
        and by 1718 construction was completed on the third meeting house.</p>
      <p>In 1785 Rev. John Ellis was installed as the minister of the church. By 1791 his ministry
        was largely unpopular within the parish, although he still maintained the support of the
        Congregationalists. The parish attempted to discharge Ellis after a salary dispute, although
        legally the parish could not summarily discharge the minister. For a while Ellis was unable
        to preach in his own church, finding himself being blocked by Baptist ministers. In 1792 the
        General Court ruled in favor of Ellis which ultimately resulted in the formation of the
        Congregational Society and further separation of parish government and church
        administration. The fourth and final meeting house was constructed in 1810. In 1812 the
        western precinct of Rehoboth was incorporated as the town of Seekonk and the church was
        renamed to the Congregational Church of Seekonk.</p>
      <p>During the 1830s the Rev. James Barney established the first Sabbath School and the Sabbath
        School library. The church community began to advocate for, and participate in,
        nineteenth-century social movements, especially the temperance and home missionary
        movements. In 1862, the governments of Massachusetts and Rhode Island settled a land dispute
        and the portion of Seekonk containing the Congregational Church became a part of East
        Providence Rhode Island. In 1886 the church was renamed to Newman Congregational Church in
        honor of the first minister.</p>
      <p>In 1961 the Newman Congregational Church voted to join the United Church of Christ. The
        church continues to serve the East Providence community today.</p>
