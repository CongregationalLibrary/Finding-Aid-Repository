        gathered in the recently designated South Farms Parish of Litchfield, Connecticut. In 1772
        George Beckwith Jr. was installed as the first minister of the church. He was removed in
        1781 after an ecclesiastical council found him guilty of adultery. The South Farms Church,
        now Morris Congregational Church, continues to serve the local community today. This
        collection contains the records of the ecclesiastical council which removed Beckwith from
        his ministerial duties at the South Farms Church.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>In 1767 the South Farms parish of Litchfield, Connecticut, was established, allowing for
        the residents, nearly all farmers, to establish their own church. That year the South Farms
        Parish Society was formed and in 1768 the South Farms Church was officially gathered. The
        church remained without a minister until 1772 when George Beckwith Jr. was ordained as the
        first minister.</p>
      <p>George Beckwith Jr. was the son of the congregational minister George Beckwith Sr. Beckwith
        Sr. was the minister at the Second Parish Church in Lyme, Connecticut, from 1730 until 1785.
        He was also a trustee of Yale. Beckwith Jr. graduated from Yale in 1766 and served as the
        minister of the South Farms Church from 1772 until 1781. Beckwith was removed as the
        minister of the South Farms Church by an ecclesiastical council called by the parish
        society. The ecclesiastical council found him guilty of breaking the seventh commandment; in
        other words, Beckwith was found guilty of adultery.</p>
      <p>In 1859 the South Farms parish was incorporated as the town of Morris, Connecticut. The
        name of the church was changed to Morris Congregational Church at that time. The Morris
        Congregational Church, now a member of the United Church of Christ, is still active in the
        local community today.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>This collection contains records related to the dismissal of Rev. George Beckwith Jr. from
        the South Farms Church in Litchfield, Connecticut. The records include the initial call for
        an ecclesiastical council by the parish society which enumerates both specific and general
        complaints against Rev. Beckwith. Of particular note is a complaint that he was
        "lasciviously attempting female chastity". Also included in the records is an invitation to
        the ecclesiastical council and the results of the ecclesiastical council. While the council
        could not corroborate all of the complaints against Rev. Beckwith, they did find him guilty
        of adultery; Rev. Beckwith was required to write a confession regarding his adultery which
        is also included in the records. The records also include a document officially removing
        Rev. Beckwith as minister of the church.</p>
