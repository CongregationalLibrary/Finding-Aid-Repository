      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Rev. Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758) was born in East Windsor, Connecticut on October 5, 1703
        to Rev. Timothy and Esther Edwards. He attended Yale for both undergraduate and graduate
        studies, graduating in 1722. He became pastor in Northampton, Massachusetts in 1726,
        succeeding his grandfather Solomon Stoddard. Johnathan Edwards died on March 22, 1758.</p>
      <p>Jonathan Edwards was an influential revivalist minister; his first public attack against
        Arminianism, a philosophy which moderated Calvinism's views on predestination, was delivered
        in Boston in 1731. Under his pastorate, Northampton underwent a major revival between 1733
        and 1734. Joseph Bellamy was one of Johnathan Edward's protégés and learned theology from
        Edwards in Northampton before his ordination in 1740 as pastor of the Congregational Church
        in Bethlehem, Connecticut.</p>
      <p>Joseph Bellamy remained the minister in Bethlehem until his death in 1790. Bellamy remained
        a close friend of Johnathan Edwards throughout his life. Bellamy published 22 books during
        his lifetime, the most famous of which was True Religion Delineated, published in 1750.
        Bellamy, much like Edwards, became a significant voice in the First Great Awakening.</p>
