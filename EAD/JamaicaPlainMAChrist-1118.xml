      <abstract>Christ Church Evangelical (Jamaica Plain, Boston, Mass.) was organized in 1901. The
        edifice was built in 1903 at 120 Chestnut Street in Jamaica Plain, Boston, Massachusetts.
        The church, which was a merger of the former German Reformed Church of Bay Village and
        German Reformed mission of Jamaica Plain, was listed as a Christ Reformed Church and Christ
        Evangelical &amp; Reformed Church before merging with the United Church of Christ in 1967.
        The last service was held the same year before the church was ultimately dissolved. This
        collection contains records from Christ Church Evangelical and a photograph from the German
        Reformed mission's circa 1900 worship site. Included are church meeting minutes written in
        German, as well as a ledger book, photographs, and treasurer's records. A copper-plated
        stamp depicts the Chestnut Street building, which burned down in the 1970s.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The modern neighborhoods of Bay Village and Jamaica Plain of Boston, Massachusetts sit on
        the ancestral land of the Massachusett and Pawtucket peoples. The future occupied sites of
        the Christ Church Evangelical (Jamaica Plain, Boston, Mass.) and its preceding organizations
        were first colonized through Puritan settlements in the Boston area in the 18th century.</p>
      <p>Christ Church Evangelical (Jamaica Plain, Boston, Mass.) was founded through the merger of
        the German Reformed Church of Bay Village, Boston, Massachusetts and the former German
        Reformed mission of Jamaica Plain, Boston, Massachusetts. The German Reformed Church was
        organized as an Evangelical church by 1847 under Reverend Louis B. Schwartz. The first
        meeting house was located in the Bay Village neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, on
        Shawmut Street, until 1895. The church was not listed in Boston City Directories again until
        it appeared again in 1900 at a new location of Danforth Street of Jamaica Plain with
        Reverend John Wirz as pastor.</p>
      <p>A separate German Reformed mission was maintained and worshipped in a store building on
        Roxbury Street in Jamaica Plain, Boston, Massachusetts, from 1897 until the organization of
        Christ Church Evangelical in 1901. A church building was erected in 1903 at 120 Chestnut
        Avenue in Jamaica Plain. The German Reformed Church at Danforth Street presumably joined the
        Jamaica Plain Christ Church in 1904. The church was first listed as Christ Reformed Church
        from 1940 to 1960 then Christ Evangelical &amp; Reformed from 1960 to 1967. Christ Church
        Evangelical joined the United Church of Christ before its last service and dissolution in
        1967. The Chestnut Avenue building burned down in the early 1970s.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>This collection contains records related to the organization of Christ Church Evangelical
        (Jamaica Plain, Boston, Mass.) in 1901. Included within the records are the photographs,
        financial records, and meetings minutes of the church. The financial records, comprised of a
        ledger book and treasurer's records, provide a membership list through the documentation of
        individual donations. Meeting minutes in German provide insight into the church's
        organization and priorities. Photographs in the collection depict the store on Roxbury
        Street used by the German Reformed mission prior to the construction of the church building
        in 1903 as well as the interior and exterior of the Chestnut Street building. A
        copper-plated stamp provides an additional representation of the fa√ßade of the Chestnut
        Street building.</p>
