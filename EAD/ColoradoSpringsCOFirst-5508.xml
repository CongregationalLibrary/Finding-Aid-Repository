      <abstract>The First Congregational Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, was organized in 1874
        in conjunction with the founding of Colorado College. The churches first two ministers were
        Johnathan Edwards and James Dougherty. The church's present building was designed by Henry
        Rutgers Marshall and construction on the building was completed in 1889. James Bartlett
        Gregg served as pastor of the church during the time of the building's construction. A house
        beside the church became the Gregg Memorial Library in honor of Gregg's 27 years as minister
        of the church. The First Congregational Church continues to serve the Colorado Springs
        community today. This collection contains three photographic prints related to the ministers
        of the First Congregational Church.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The Ute, Arapaho, and Cheyenne peoples were the first known inhabitants in the region that
        is today's Colorado Springs, Colorado. American and European settlers first began settling
        in significant numbers in the region during various gold rushes during the 1850s and 1860s.
        Colorado Springs was founded in 1871 on a region downstream from Old Colorado City and the
        town was officially named Colorado Springs by 1879. Colorado Springs was incorporated in
        1886.</p>
      <p>The First Congregational Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, was organized in 1874 in
        conjunction with the founding of Colorado College. The college itself was founded, in part,
        with the backing of the Congregationalists from Colorado's Ministerial Congregational
        Association who desired to have a Christian college in the territory. The churches first two
        minister, Johnathan Edwards and James Dougherty, were also employed by Colorado College.</p>
      <p>The cornerstone for a new church building to house the First Congregational Church was laid
        on September 8, 1888. The building was designed by Henry Rutgers Marshall and was
        constructed using stone quarried at Castle Rock, Colorado. A small church library was a part
        of the original design. Construction on the building was completed in 1889 and the
        building's inaugural worship service was held on July 21, 1889 with James B. Gregg leading
        the service. The dedication service was delayed until October of that year though so that
        the installation of a Hook and Hastings organ could be completed. Around 1935, a small house
        was donated to the church in memory of Gregg's 27-year pastorate and the church library
        moved into the house to form the Gregg Memorial Library. The First Congregational Church was
        placed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 31, 2002. The First
        Congregational Church, now a member of the United Church of Christ, continues to serve the
        Colorado Springs community today.</p>
