        Congregational Church in Falmouth, was formally gathered and Josiah Metcalf was ordained as
        the church's first minister. The first meeting house was probably built between 1690 and
        1700 and was replaced by the second meeting house in 1717. The third meeting house was
        constructed in 1750 and the fourth, and final, meeting house was constructed in 1796. In
        1821, 77 members withdrew to form the East End Church in Hatchville and in 1833, 9 members
        withdrew to form the North Falmouth Congregational Church. Now a member of the United Church
        of Christ, the First Congregational Church in Falmouth continues to serve the local
        community. This collection contains a single volume of early church records and includes
        both church meeting minutes and vital membership records.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>Though the town of Falmouth, Massachusetts, was incorporated in 1686, the town did not have
        a formal congregational church until over 20 years later. The town's inhabitants largely
        belonged to the Congregational Church in Barnstable and worshiped in Falmouth at a "branch
        church." The first minister of the Falmouth community was, Jonathan Dunham, a lay preacher,
        who served from about 1677 to 1684. He was followed by another lay preacher, Samuel
        Shiverick, a Huguenot refugee, who served from about 1687 to 1703. The first meeting house
        was probably built between 1690 and 1700. In 1707 Josiah Metcalf was called to serve as the
        minister. On October, 10, 1708, the First Congregational Church in Falmouth, was formally
        gathered and Josiah Metcalf was ordained as the church's first minister. He served as the
        minister until his death in 1723. In 1717 the second meeting house was constructed to
        replace the first. Construction on the third meeting house, known as the meeting house on
        the green, was completed in 1750 after eight years of discussion during church meetings.</p>
      <p>A church library was established in 1789. By 1791 the church building was in disrepair; the
        fourth, and final, meeting house constructed to replace the 1750 building, was completed in
        1796. The church purchased a bell from Paul Revere for the new building; the bell is still
        housed at the church today. In 1821, 77 members withdrew over theological differences with
        Rev. Henry Lincoln and his adoption of a particularly strict Confession of Faith. They
        formed the East End Church in Hatchville. Even after Rev. Lincoln was forced to resign in
        1823, the church continued to lose members over his theological beliefs, with many being
        dismissed to the Methodist Episcopal Church in Falmouth. In 1824 the church established a
        Sunday school. In 1833, nine members withdrew to form the North Falmouth Congregational
        Church; it appears that these members disagreed with the church's adoption of a strict
        temperance resolution. In 1837 the first church missionary society was founded. In 1857 the
        meeting house was deconstructed and rebuilt, with significant changes done to the steeple,
        windows, and pews, on its present location.</p>
      <p>The First Congregational Church in Falmouth continues to serve the local community and is
        now a member of the United Church of Christ.</p>
