      <abstract>The Congregational Church of Arlington Heights, Illinois, was gathered in 1959. The
        church was seeded, initially, by the Church Extension Committee of the Illinois Conference
        of the United Church of Christ. Construction of the church's sole building was completed in
        1963. In 1964, the name of the church was changed to the Congregational United Church of
        Christ. Throughout the church's history, the church was focused on mission work. The church
        underwent a restructuring process starting in 1998 that was completed in 2000. The church
        became Open and Affirming in the early 2000s. The church closed in 2024. The collection
        contains both administrative records and vital membership records and includes a church
        register and an accompanying index, constitutions, building legal records, membership lists,
        baptismal records, and marriage records.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The Congregational Church of Arlington Heights, Illinois, was gathered in 1959 with Rev. W.
        Rowland Koch serving as the first minister. The church was seeded, initially, by the Church
        Extension Committee of the Illinois Conference of the United Church of Christ. Koch moved to
        Arlington Heights in January of 1959 and began work to gather a church. A steering committee
        was formed in April and the first service for the church was held on May 3, 1959. Worship
        was originally held at the Pioneer Park Fieldhouse and then at the South Junior High School
        until September of 1963 when construction on a church building was completed. In 1964 the
        name of the church was changed to Congregational United Church of Christ.</p>
      <p>During Rev. Koch's pastorate, the church became very involved in mission-based work with
        the formation of the Missions and Stewardship, Social Action, Women's Fellowship, and
        Pilgrim Fellowship committees. Some of the mission work included the sponsoring of a Cuban
        refugee family and the Vietnamese Boat People, the Pleasant Valley Farm venture, and Casa
        Central in Chicago. Rev. Koch served alone until 1980 when Rev. Nan Conser was hired as an
        associate pastor. Rev. Koch pulled back from pastoral duties in 1985 due to illness and both
        he and Rev. Conser retired from the church in 1987.</p>
      <p>They were succeeded by Rev. Howard Bowman in 1988. His pastorate ended in 1997 and he
        followed by Pastor Jeffrey Phillips, an openly gay clergyman. During his short tenure at the
        church, Pastor Jeffrey proposed a restructuring of the church from committees into Ministry
        teams. That work was taken up by the Revisioning Committee. In 1999, Rev. David Russel
        became the minister of the church and the work of the Revisioning Committee was completed in
        2000.</p>
      <p>The 2000s saw the church's mission work focus on the local community. The church's back
        property was converted into a community garden and the church held frequent choir concerts
        open to all. The church also took on the Open and Affirming status in the early 2000s. The
        church continued to serve the Arlington Heights community until 2024 when it dissolved.</p>
