      <abstract id="aspace_8f1dcdbdbc3172308d18cea57797f246">Haverhill was first settled by Puritans
        in 1640. Rev. John Ward was officially installed as the pastor of the First Parish in 1645
        and the first meeting house was constructed in 1648. The second meeting house was completed
        in 1699 and the third was completed in 1766. In 1833 the First Parish became Unitarian and
        the Congregationalist dissenters formed the Independent Congregational Church and Society
        which was later renamed to the Centre Congregational Church and Society. In 1859 a large
        group of parishioners left the Centre Congregational Church to form the North Congregational
        Church. In 1940 the Centre and North Churches merged to form the First Congregational
        Church. In 1963 the North Parish Community Church merged into the First Congregational
        Church which simultaneously joined the United Church of Christ. In 2010 the First
        Congregational Church in Haverhill dissolved. This collection contains the administrative,
        financial, and important membership records of the First Parish Church, North Congregational
        Church, Centre Congregational Church, First Congregational Church, and North Parish

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The land eventually called Haverhill was first settled by Puritans in 1640. In 1641 Rev.
        John Ward, from Haverhill England, came to the young settlement and became the first
        minister; the town was incorporated in1641 and named Haverhill after Ward's birthplace. The
        town lands were formally purchased from the Pentuckets in 1642. Rev. Ward was officially
        installed as the pastor of the First Parish in 1645 and the first meeting house was
        constructed in 1648. Rev. Ward served as the minister until his death in 1693. He was
        followed by Rev. Benjamin Rolfe and was installed in 1694. Construction on the second
        meeting house began in 1697 and was completed in 1699.</p>
      <p>The town of Haverhill was separated into multiple parishes during the early
        eighteenth-century. In 1728 the town was divided into two parishes with the formation of the
        North Parish. The North Parish was transferred to Plaistow, New Hampshire in 1741 and the
        Rockingham Congregational Church was formed. In 1734 the town was divided yet again with the
        formation of the West Parish and the East Parish was formed in 1743. In 1748 a bell,
        imported from London, was installed in the First Parish church. The third meeting house was
        constructed 1766.</p>
      <p>Rev. Dudley Phelps, a strict orthodox Congregationalist, was installed as the pastor of the
        First Parish in 1828. His strict orthodoxy became a point of contention and the parish
        dissolved its relation with Rev. Phelps in 1832. The First Parish, which kept the third
        meeting house, became a Unitarian church after the split. In 1833 the Independent
        Congregational Church and Society was formed with Rev. Joseph Whittelsey as its first
        minister. In 1840 the name was changed to Centre Congregational Church and Society. The new
        church originally worshipped at the Summer Street Church and Academy Hall until 1834 when a
        new church building was constructed. The church had a small separation in 1839 when
        seventeen members withdrew to form the Union Evangelical Church of Haverhill. That church
        was later renamed to the Winter Street Church. The winter street church was dissolved in
        1860. By 1859 the Centre Congregational Church had grown significantly and it was decided
        that a portion of the parish would leave to form a new church in the north of Haverhill. In
        1859 100 former members of the Centre Church formed the North Congregational Church. In 1891
        some members of both the North and Centre Congregational Churches joined together to form
        the Union Congregational Church. The Union Congregational Church dissolved in 1932.</p>
      <p>The first building of the North Congregational Church was completed in 1860. In the early
        twentieth-century, the building was renovated with Tiffany memorial windows. In 1929 the
        North Parish Community Church was formed after the dissolution of the Rockingham
        Congregational Church in Plaistow, New Hampshire. In 1940 the Centre Congregational Church
        and North Congregational Church merged to form the First Congregational Church in Haverhill
        which occupied the North Church building. In 1963 the North Parish Community Church merged
        into the First Congregational Church; at the same time the First Congregational Church
        joined the United Church of Christ. In 2010 the 1860 church building was sold and the First
        Congregational Church was formally dissolved.</p>

            <p>This folder contains records of disciplinary cases in Haverhill. Punishment in many
              cases usually consisted of censure — a temporary restriction from attending services
              and participating in church business — until the guilty party made a formal confession
              or request for forgiveness.</p>

            <p>This folder contains the financial records of the First Parish and one of its early
              ministers. A two page document attributed to Deacon White contains information on
              parish expenses, tax rates, and meeting minutes. A string bound pamphlet lists the
              accounts of Rev. Edward Barnard. Many of the entries in the ledger are paired with an
              entry on the following page: accounts paid with cash or in-kind. A booklet kept by
              Rev. Edward Barnard contains a list of presents, mostly foodstuffs, received as part
              of his salary, official or otherwise.</p>

              <p>This disbound volume is somewhat confusing and difficult to classify; it appears to
                include records and materials related to both the North Congregational Church and
                the First Congregational Church. As the volume appears to begin with the North
                Congregational Church it has been placed here within the arrangement.</p>

            <p>This sub-series contains extensive copies of near weekly newsletters and orders of
              worship produced by the First Congregational Church. These newsletters are not
              complete as occasional single issues and some major gaps exist. However, overall, it
              is a fascinatingly thorough accounting of the weekly activities of the church and
              church community.</p>
