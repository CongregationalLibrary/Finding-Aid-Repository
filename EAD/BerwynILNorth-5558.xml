      <abstract>On February 8, 1910, the North Berwyn Congregational Church was formally
        established. It was initially supported, financially, by the First Church of Oak Park before
        being supported by the Chicago Congregational Union, later known as the Chicago City
        Missionary Society. After nearly closing during the Great Depression, the church building
        was expanded in 1938. A new church building was constructed in 1956 and this building too
        received an expansion almost a decade later. The church joined with the United Church of
        Christ. Membership declined after the North Berwyn community changed during the 1970s. The
        church dissolved circa 2008. This collection contains both administrative and membership
        related materials and includes church records, annual reports, council records, newsletters,
        histories, and membership records.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>By 1906, the First Church of Oak Park was involved in multiple home missionary projects
        within the growing community of northern Berwyn, a Chicago suburb. These projects including
        supporting a Sunday School and a Women's Aid Society in the community. In 1909, Rev. F. V.
        Bastel was called to become the leader of these missionary efforts. At this time, serious
        thought was put into establishing a permanent church in the neighborhood. In December 1909,
        a petition of more than 30 persons was presented to the First Church of Oak Park requesting
        the formal establishment of the North Berwyn Congregational Church. On February 8, 1910, the
        church was formally established and the First Church of Oak Park was the primary financial
        source for the church until 1914. After the establishment of the church, Rev. George Milne
        was called to become the church's pastor.</p>
      <p>After 1914, financial support for the church was transferred to the Chicago Congregational
        Union, later known as the Chicago City Missionary Society. The church nearly closed, as the
        suggestion of the Chicago Congregational Union, during the Great Depression, but the small
        numbers of members at the time managed to keep the church active. The church saw growth
        again after the great depression and expanded their church building in response with the
        dedication for the expansion held in May 1938.</p>
      <p>The church continued to see growth throughout the 1940s and 1950s. By the mid-1950s, the
        church saw the need for a new church building. A new church building was constructed in 1956
        with the dedication in October of that year. At the same time, the church became financially
        solvent and no longer needed financial assistance from the Chicago City Missionary Society.
        The church building saw another extension in the 1960s. The church also joined with the
        United Church of Christ following the denominations formation in 1957.</p>
      <p>By 1970, the population of North Berwyn had seen significant changes, with many moving
        further out to the suburbs and the Catholic community growing. Between 1971 and 1974, the
        North Berwyn Congregational Church shared a pastor with the Plymouth Congregational Church
        in Maywood. In 1979, the church fully payed off the mortgage and celebrated with a mortgage
        burning. During the 1980s and beyond, the church worked closely with the wider North Berwyn
        community, participating in ecumenical events and opening up the church as a space for
        community and secular groups to gather. The North Berwyn Congregational Church dissolved
        circa 2008.</p>
