      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The region around the base of Pikes Peak was originally inhabited by the Ute people.
        Cripple Creek was largely settled by Americans during the last of Colorado's gold rushes in
        the early 1890s. The city of Cripple Creek, Colorado, was incorporated in 1892, the same
        year that the First Congregational Church in Cripple Creek was gathered. The church was
        known as The Union Church by the 1940s and in later years it would be known as The United
        Church. The church joined the United Church of Christ in 1962. The church was dissolved in
        1983.</p>
