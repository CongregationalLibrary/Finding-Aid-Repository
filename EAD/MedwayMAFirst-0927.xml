      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>Originally named Boggastow in Nipmuck Territory, then part of Medfield, Medway was settled
        in 1657 when an increasing number of colonists settled the land west of the Charles River.
        The settlement grew enough that by 1712 the Massachusetts General Court was petitioned to
        create a separate town; Medway was incorporated on October 25, 1713 and the decision to
        immediately build its own church was made at town meeting on November 23, 1713.</p>
      <p>Until the church's construction was finished, services were held by Reverend David Deming
        at Peter Adams's house. The Church of Christ, later known as First Church of Christ, was
        organized on October 7, 1714. A subscription, led by Jonathan Plimpton, raised a noon house
        in 1730. In 1749 the first meetinghouse burned. In 1748 Medway divided into eastern and
        western precincts with First Church of Christ in the eastern precinct and Second Church
        organizing in 1750 in the western precinct. A large undevelopable tract of land known as The
        Black Swamp divided the two. The section known as East Medway separated in 1885 to form the
        town of Millis; First Church of Christ Medway is physically located in modern day Millis,
        Massachusetts.</p>

          <p>These records are about disciplinary cases in Medway during this period. During the
            colonial period, the local church often functioned as the legal authority in matters of
            morality. Punishment in such cases usually consisted of censure — a temporary
            restriction from attending services and participating in church business — until the
            guilty party made a formal confession or request for forgiveness. Of particular notes is
            the case of David Pond of Wrentham who struck a pitch, created a disturbance was
            excommunicated from his church, and requested admission to First Church in Medway.</p>
