      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The first religious organization in York, Maine dates back to the establishment of a
        meetinghouse, or oratory, in the mid to late 1630s. This first organization was likely
        established according to the Royal Charter given Sir Ferdinando Gorges by Charles I in 1639
        and therefore was an extension of the Church of England. The land that encompasses today's
        York, Maine was incorporated in 1742 as Gorgeana and became the capital of Gorges' province.
        After the death of Gorges in 1647, the Massachusetts Bay Colony claimed Gorges' land. In
        1652 York, Massachusetts was incorporated from a portion of Gorgeana. Little is known about
        the first established religious organization but following the death of Gorges and the
        administration of his lands by the Massachusetts Bay Colony, it is likely that whatever
        remained of that first church organization was either dissolved or slowly replaced with
        Puritan influence during the 1650s.</p>
      <p>The exact date of the establishment of the First Parish Church in York is not known, though
        it likely dates to somewhere between 1662 and 1673. In 1662, Shubael Drummer, a 1656
        graduate of Harvard, became the first Congregational minister in York. Under his leadership,
        the "second" meetinghouse was constructed in 1667. He was officially ordained as the pastor
        of the Church of Christ at York on December 3, 1673. In 1692, during King Williams War, a
        Native American raid on York, also referred to as the Candlemas Massacre, resulted in the
        death of Rev. Drummer and the burning of much of the town. Apparently the church building
        survived and in 1698 Samuel Moody was ordained as the second pastor.</p>
      <p>During Rev. Moody's pastorate, the Third Meetinghouse was constructed. In 1710 the 1667
        meetinghouse was deemed unsafe and so the town procured funds for a new building which was
        finally completed in 1712. Under Moody church membership grew to about 300. In 1732 the
        Second Church was established by Scottish immigrants with Rev. Joseph Moody, son of Rev.
        Samuel Moody, installed as the first minister. In 1744 the town voted to raise funds through
        subscriptions to raise a fourth meetinghouse. Plans for construction were stalled until 1747
        and construction completed that same year. Rev. Moody's ministry ended with his death in
        1747. He was followed by Rev. Isaac Lyman who was ordained on Dec. 20, 1749 and likewise
        ended his pastorate with his death on March 12, 1810.</p>
      <p>During the 1820s the church underwent a period of instability as disagreements over
        religious doctrine resulted in multiple waves of members leaving to join other area churches
        such as the Methodist and Universalist churches. The Sabbath School was established in the
        1830s and was soon followed by the establishment of the Sabbath School Library. A religious
        revival during the 1860s greatly increased church membership. In 1882, the parish came to a
        decision to move the church so that it physically faced the road. That year it was lifted
        and placed in the church's present location in York. In 1951 the church building underwent a
        major renovation project.</p>
      <p>The First Parish Church Congregational, United Church of Christ, in York Maine, continues
        to serve the community today. It is the oldest still active religious society in Maine.</p>

          <p>This volume contains the administrative records for the Parish of York. The majority of
            the records are related to votes held to appoint assessors and tax collectors for the
            York Parish and to raise funds to maintain the meeting house and church lands.
            Significantly though, about three years of records detail the votes held in relation to
            the purchase of a slave for the use of the parish and for the assistance of Rev. Samuel
            Moody. The records begin in 1733 when there was a vote to form a committee to purchase a
            slave. In 1734 there was a vote to raise 120 pounds to purchase a slave "to be Imployed
            in his Service during the Parish's Pleasure". Apparently the committee did procure an
            African slave who was identified only as "the Negro man named Andrew". In 1735, the
            records indicate that the committee voted to sell Andrew and hired a domestic worker
            instead, citing Moody's dissatisfaction with Andrew.</p>

          <p>These church records contain both ministerial records and important membership records.
            Included within the volume are meeting minutes, ecclesiastical council minutes and
            decisions, committee reports, baptismal records, marriage records, and records of
            deaths. Also included within the records are the Church Covenant, with a list of all
            members who belonged to the covenant, and the Confession of Faith.</p>

          <p>There were a number of loose documents within the volume located between pages 32 and
            33. Most of these were records of death and placed in the folder titled "Death records,
            1807-1810." Another loose document was a continuation of the "Isaac Lyman marriage
            records, 1765-1829" and was therefore placed with that volume.</p>
