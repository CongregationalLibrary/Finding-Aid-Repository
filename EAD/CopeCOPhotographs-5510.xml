      <abstract>Cope, Colorado, was named after Johnathan C. Cope, an officer of the Burlington
        Railroad Company. The Cope Congregational Church, according to Richard Taylor, was founded
        in 1896 and closed in 1910 and Taylor states that Happy Valley Congregational Church was
        founded in 1917 and closed in 1919. This collection contains a series of photographs that

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>Cope, Colorado, was named after Johnathan C. Cope, an officer of the Burlington Railroad
        Company who was sent by the company to the area to homestead a railroad terminal site. Cope
        Colorado has had an operational post office since 1889. The Cope Congregational Church,
        according to Richard Taylor, was founded in 1896 and closed in 1910. Also, according to
        Taylor, there was a Happy Valley Congregational Church in Cope from 1917 to 1919. These
        churches may have been succeeded by the Cope Community Church which is active today.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>This collection contains a series of photographs that depict various buildings from in and
        around Cope, Colorado. There is also a photograph that depicts the exterior of the First
        Congregational Church in Stratton, Congregational. Every photograph has a caption. There is
        a note with the photographs that suggests that the photographs came from a Church in Cope,
        however, the Congregational Churches in Cope had closed before the dates on the photographs.
        As such, the exact provenance of the collection is questionable.</p>
