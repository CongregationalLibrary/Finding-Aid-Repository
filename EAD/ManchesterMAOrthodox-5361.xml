        Manchester-by the-Sea, Massachusetts, was formed on November 7, 1716 with 21 members. The
        first meeting house was constructed in 1656, the second in 1695, and the third in 1719. The
        fourth and final meeting house was constructed in 1809. The church name was changed to
        Orthodox Congregational Church in 1843. The church split in 1857 due to ecclesiastical
        differences and was reformed in 1869. The church, now known as the First Parish
        Congregational Church in Manchester-by-the-Sea continues to serve the community today. The
        collection includes the earliest extant records of the church. Included within the records
        are administrative records, vital records, financial records and records relating to the
        1957 ecclesiastical council that led to the church splitting.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The First Congregational Church in Manchester-by the-Sea, Massachusetts, was formed on
        November 7, 1716 with 21 members, 71 years after the incorporation of the town of
        Manchester. The first minister of the newly formed church was Rev. Ames Cheever. Prior to
        the formation of the church, the inhabitants of Manchester worshipped first at Salem and
        then at Beverly. However, the town of Manchester still had a meeting house, with the first
        constructed in 1656 and the second constructed in 1695. A third meeting house was
        constructed shortly after the formation of the First Church in 1719.</p>
      <p>The fourth and final meeting house was built in 1809 and was co-owned by both the town of
        Manchester and the church proprietors. The church's Sunday school was founded in June of
        1810. In 1843 the name of the church was changed to the Orthodox Congregational Church. In
        1844 the church proprietors bought out the town and therefore fully controlled the meeting
        house thereafter. The building underwent further renovations in 1846. In 1857, an
        ecclesiastical dispute resulted in about two-thirds of the parish separating from the church
        and forming a new church with Rev. F. V. Fenny as the minister. The two churches were
        reunited in 1869.</p>
      <p>In 1902 the church was officially incorporated under Massachusetts law and a new covenant
        and revised by-laws were adopted. In 1979 the church adopted the name First Parish Church
        Congregational. A member of the United Church of Christ, the First Parish Church
        Congregational continues to serve the community of Manchester-by-the-Sea.</p>
