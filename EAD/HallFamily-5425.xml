      <abstract>Gordon Hall was a missionary to India who was from Tolland, Massachusetts. While in
        India he met Margaret Lewis, who had lived there for over 20 years. They would eventually
        get married and have four kids together, though only one survived into adulthood. That
        child, first born Nathan and then Gordon, was a minister who served in Wilton, Connecticut
        and Northampton, Massachusetts. Gordon would marry Emily Baldwin Hall and they would have
        seven children together. One of those children, Gordon Robert Hall, was a working physician
        in New York. Samuel and Clarina Bradley Merwin were the parents of Emily Baldwin Hall and
        lived mainly in New Haven, Connecticut. This collection contains letters to Margaret Lewis
        Hall as well as letters to and from her son, Gordon Hall, and a letter from Samuel Merwin to
        Clarina Bradley Merwin. Also included are financial documents related to the Hall Family,
        including a marriage settlement and a certificate of capital stock.</abstract>

      <p>Gordon Hall was born on April 8, 1784 in Tolland, Massachusetts. His parents were Nathan
        and Elizabeth Hall. Gordon went to Williams College between 1805 and 1808. After graduation,
        he worked as a minister in Woodbury, Connecticut from 1809-1810. He also spent some time
        working in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Hall would enroll in Andover Theological Seminary in
        1810 and eventually be ordained on February 6th, 1812. That same month, the American Board
        of Commissioners for Foreign Missions sent Hall and four others to India. Upon arrival, Hall
        went to Bombay with fellow missionary Samuel Nott. He would eventually marry Margaret Lewis
        in December of 1816. They would have four children together, though only one would survive
        into adulthood. In 1826, while touring areas of the country with outbreaks of cholera, he
        contracted the disease and died.</p>
      <p>Margaret Lewis Hall was born in Wales on July 20, 1783. She moved to India and while there
        learned to speak Hindustani. She met Gordon Hall in Bombay and they would marry in 1816.
        They would have four children together, though only one would survive into adulthood. In
        1825, she left with their two sons for Salem, Massachusetts in order to leave them with
        relatives. One of the sons would die on the journey and when Gordon died the following year,
        she remained in the United States. She died in Northampton, Massachusetts on January 25,
        1868.</p>
      <p>Gordon Hall was born Nathan Hall on November 4, 1823 in India. He was the youngest child of
        Margaret and Gordon and the only one to survive past childhood. At some point he would
        change his name from Nathan to Gordon. He attended Yale in 1843 and also Yale Theological
        Seminary in 1847. He served as minister in Wilton, Connecticut from 1848 to 1852 and then at
        the Edwards Church in Northampton, Massachusetts from 1852 until his death. He received an
        honorary divinity degree from Amherst College in 1864. Gordon married Emily Baldwin Merwin
        in 1848 and they had seven children together. Gordon died on November 5, 1879 of typhoid
        pneumonia.</p>
      <p>Gordon Robert Hall was born on September 28, 1849 in Wilton, Connecticut. His mother was
        Emily Baldwin Hall and father was Gordon Hall. Hall graduated from Amherst College in 1872
        and then the College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1880. He was a working physician at Kings
        County Hospital and a consultant in hospitals in New York. He died on October 23, 1923 in
        Brooklyn, New York.</p>
      <p>Samuel Merwin was the father of Emily Baldwin Hall, who would eventually marry Gordon Hall.
        He was born on May 21, 1781 and was a minister in New Haven, Connecticut. He died on
        September 3, 1856 in New Haven.</p>
      <p>Clarina Bradley Merwin was the mother of Emily Baldwin Hall, who would eventually marry
        Gordon hall. She was born in Danbury, Connecticut in 1788 and died in New Haven, Connecticut
        in 1859.</p>
