      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Rev. Samuel Hopkins (1721-1803) was a Congregational minister in the New England area. Born
        in Connecticut, he was educated at Yale, and later studied under the Reverend Johnathan
        Edwards. Hopkins preached in Sheffield (now Great Barrington), Massachusetts, from
        1743-1769, until a difference in theology between Hopkins and his congregation resulted in
        his dismission due to a lack of financial support for his continued pastorate. Hopkins
        traveled to Newport, Rhode Island, in 1770 to preach at the First Congregational Church. He
        continued to preach there until his death in 1803. During the Revolutionary War, Hopkins
        fled Newport, and continued to preach at Newburyport, Massachusetts, as well as Canterbury
        and Stamford, Connecticut.</p>
      <p>Hopkins' work with Johnathan Edwards and Joseph Bellamy resulted in the theological scheme
        known as New Divinity, Hopkinsianism, and New England Theology, among other names. Initially
        a slave holder himself, Hopkins later became one of the earliest Congregationalists to
        condemn the institution of slavery.</p>

            <p>This letter, likely dictated by Rev Samuel Hopkins to a scribe, was addressed to Mr.
              Fuller in Newport, Rhode Island. The letter opens with a statement about the Hopkins
              declining health. The majority of the letter is a theological argument on how
              determine what a true Christian is, how to think about faith, and how an individual
