      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The town of Wenham, originally a part of Salem, was first settled in 1635 though land
        grants were not issued until around 1638. John Fiske, a wealthy minister and physician,
        moved from Salem proper to the Wenham area around 1641. He was instrumental in the
        establishment of a church in the community. In 1642 the first meeting house was constructed
        and in 1643 the General Court of Massachusetts recognized Wenham as an independent town. The
        Congregational Church in Wenham was established on October 8, 1644 after previous petitions
        to organize had been denied. Rev. Fiske was left Wenham to settle in Chelmsford in 1654 and
        seven other Wenham families followed him. The remaining members called Rev. Antipas Newman.
        In 1663, the second meeting house was constructed after a year of difficult planning. Rev.
        Joseph Garrish was called to be minister in 1673 and the town provided him with a parsonage
        to ensure he accepted the offer. He served as the minister for 47 years until his death in
        1720. The third meeting house was constructed in 1688.</p>
      <p>The fourth meeting house was constructed in 1748 on the same spot as the third meeting
        house. An informal Sunday school was established in 1815 and taught by Miss Elizabeth Shaw;
        the church formally established a Sunday school in 1822. The Congregational Parish and
        Society was established in 1833 following the formal separation of church and state in
        Massachusetts. The fifth and final meeting house was constructed in 1843 and this building
        was further enlarged a few years later in 1853. The church purchased an organ in 1851. This
        organ was replaced in 1910 with an Esty organ with the help of a small grant from Andrew
        Carnegie. This was also replaced in 1959 after the organ became inoperable in 1955. In 1925,
        the Parish and Society were dissolved and the First Church in Wenham Congregational was
        incorporated. The fifth meeting house underwent additional renovations and expansions in
        1953 and 1986.</p>
      <p>The First Church in Wenham Congregational, UCC, continues to serve the local community
        today.</p>
