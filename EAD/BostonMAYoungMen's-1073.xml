      <abstract  label="Abstract">The Young Men's
        Congregational Club was founded in 1896 with the goal of advancing Congregationalism in the
        greater Boston area through monthly meetings addressing current social, moral, and religious
        issues facing the community. The first meeting was held at the American House on November
        11, 1896, and following meetings were held on the first Wednesday evening of every month, 7
        months out of the year. Dates for this collection span 1896-1912, but it is unknown whether
        the club continued or dissolved after the latest date appearing in this collection. The
        Young Men's Congregational Club records include bound volumes of club records, including
        club constitution and by-laws, membership lists, meeting minutes, attendance lists, ballots,
        correspondence, and a copy of the club's charter. Among the bound volumes are two scrapbooks
        containing those materials, as well as news clippings, event and lecture programs, meeting
        menus, membership cards and applications, and treasurer reports.</abstract>

      <p>The Young Men's Congregational Club was founded in 1896 with the goal of advancing
        Congregationalism in the greater Boston area through monthly meetings addressing current
        social, moral, and religious issues facing the community. The first meeting was held at the
        American House on November 11, 1896, with 65 attendees. The following meetings were held at
        5:30 pm on the first Wednesday evening of every month except January, June, July, August,
        and September. Each meeting included prayer, minutes from the previous meeting, Committee
        reports, ongoing business, and the current evening's itinerary. Meetings also commonly
        included seated dinners and chosen speakers. The club held regular elections to determine
        leadership roles including president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, and auditor, and
        had several committers such has Executive Committee, The Membership Committee, the Outlook
        Committee, and the Social Committee. Club membership was restricted to male members of
        Trinitarian Congregational church over the age of 21, and membership was considered upon
        formal proposal at previous meetings and recommendation by the Membership Committee.
        Membership was limited to a total of 150 members. </p>
      <p>Dates for this collection span 1896-1912, but it is unknown whether the club continued or
        dissolved after the latest date appearing in this collection.</p>
