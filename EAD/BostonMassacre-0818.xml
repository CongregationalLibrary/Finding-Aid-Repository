      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The author of the manuscript sermon in this collection is unknown and there is no
        provenance information associated with the collection. The instigating incident behind the
        writing of the sermon was the Boston Massacre, also known as the Incident on King Street,
        which occurred on March 5, 1770. Prior to the event, tensions between civilians and British
        soldiers in the city of Boston, Massachusetts, had grown significantly. On the evening of
        March 5, 1770, a mob formed around a lone British sentry and verbally accosted him.
        Eventually the sentry was backed up by eight additional soldiers. Accounts of what exactly
        occurred differ greatly, but it is almost certain that the mob tossed snowballs, stones, and
        possibly clubs, at the soldiers who, in retaliation and/or self-defense, fired upon the
        crowd. Three civilians were announced dead at the scene and an additional two died later
        from wounds sustained at the scene. Eight soldiers and an officer were later arrested on
        charges of murder; they were represented by John Adams and most were acquitted of all
        charges while two were convicted of manslaughter with a reduced sentence. The "Boston
        Massacre," as it had been dubbed, was widely reported on, much of it in the form of
        propaganda, and further increased tensions between the Thirteen Colonies and Great
        Britain.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>This collection consists of a single manuscript sermon written by an unknown author. A note
        found on the back of the booklet, in a separate hand, notes that the sermon was "prepared
        soon after the Boston Massacre, March, 5, 1770." The sermon cites Psalms 85:6. The sermon
        contains the author's account of the history of Massachusetts Bay Colony leading up to the
        massacre. The sermon further includes discussions about the causes of colonial strife,
        namely the younger generation, and advice for how to better the situation, namely a
        restoration of the ways of the past.</p>
