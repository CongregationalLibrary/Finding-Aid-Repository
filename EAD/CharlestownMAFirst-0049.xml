      <abstract>Charlestown proper was founded in 1628 and formally settled on July 4, 1629. The
        First Church of Charlestown was gathered in 1632. The church's third meeting house was
        destroyed during the Battle of Bunker Hill and the fourth meeting house was not constructed
        until 1783 after the American Revolutionary War had ended. In 1913, the Winthrop Church
        merged with the First Church. In 1957, the interior of the church was destroyed by a fire;
        financial hardship delayed the restoration of the church for many years. In 2014, the First
        Church partnered with Celebration Church, a Brazilian congregation, to renew and renovate
        the church. In 2022, the First Church merged with Christ Church Charlestown, who inherited
        the church building and now worships there. This collection contains important
        administrative records for the First Church in Charlestown, Boston, Massachusetts as well as
        the records of the First Parish in Charlestown. The collection includes parish records,
        building records, and financial records.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>Prior to English colonization, the are today known as Charlestown, Boston, Massachusetts,
        was inhabited by the indigenous Massachusett. Charlestown was called Mishawum by the
        Massachusett. The first English colonizers were Thomas and Jane Walford who arrived in
        Mishawum in 1624. Charlestown proper was founded in 1628 and formally settled on July 4,
        1629. A church was founded in Charlestown in 1630, but when John Winthrop accepted William
        Blaxton's invitation to settle on the Shawmut peninsula, the majority of that early church's
        membership withdrew. The 35 original members of the church who still resided in Charlestown
        sought dismissal from the church and recovenanted as the First Church of Charlestown on
        November 2, 1632. The first meeting house was made from Governor Winthrop's "Great House"
        and a second meeting house was built in 1636. John Harvard was the church's third minister;
        he died in 1638. Harvard College was renamed in honor of John Harvard after he had
        bequeathed his entire library and half of his monetary estate to the college in his
        will.</p>
      <p>The third meetinghouse was constructed in 1715. That building was destroyed during the
        Battle of Bunker Hill, during the American Revolution, when British troops almost completely
        destroyed the town. The town did not truly begin to rebuild until after the American
        Revolutionary War ended in 1783; the fourth meeting house was constructed in 1783. This
        building was expanded in 1804. The fifth meeting house was constructed in 1834 and the sixth
        was constructed in 1853. In 1834, a second Congregational Church, known as the Winthrop
        Congregational Church, was gathered. This church merged with the First Church in 1913 and
        the Winthrop Church building became the First Church's seventh church building.</p>
      <p>In 1957, the church's interior was destroyed by a fire. The church suffered financial
        hardships following the fire and the building could only be restored after many years.
        During the racial protests and violence which enveloped Boston between 1974 and 1976, the
        First Church became a safe haven for African American students. In 2014, the church began a
        revitalization process with Celebration Church, a Brazillian congregation; the result of
        this partnership was a refurbished church building in 2016. In 2015, with the installation
        of Erik Maloy, the church became a member of the Southern Baptist Convention alongside its
        continued membership with the United Church of Christ. In 2022, the First Church merged with
        Christ Church Charlestown who inherited the church building and now holds worship there.</p>

          <p>In 1880, for James Frothingham Dunnewell, 62 copies of a reproduction of the First
            Church's earliest records were created. Each volume was numbered. The Congregational
            Library &amp; Archives holds copies two and five, of the 62 copy run, as well as a
            photocopied copy of copy number 5 which was created due to the fragility of the
            original. The CLA also holds two microfilm copies, positive and negative, of the 1800
            reproduction.</p>
