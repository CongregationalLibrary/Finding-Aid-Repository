      <abstract>On September 23, 1874, a meeting was called for the organization of a Congregational
        church in Wollaston, Quincy, Massachusetts. The resulting Wollaston Congregational Society
        met in local churches and member residences until the completion of the first meeting house,
        which was erected in 1875 and dedicated in 1876. Wollaston Congregational Church was
        officially incorporated on November 15, 1898. Construction on a replacement for the first
        meeting house ended with a dedication on March 28 1926. Wollaston Congregational Church
        voted to join the United Church of Christ on January 29, 1960 and is still active today.
        This collection contains the earliest records of Wollaston Congregational Church and its
        auxiliary groups and includes financial records, membership lists, meeting minutes, reports,
        and correspondence. A church history, produced as a scrapbook in 1951, documents the first
        75 years of the church.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>The land that is modern Quincy, Massachusetts is the historic seat of the Neponset Band of 
         the Massachusett Tribe's leader Sac'hem Chickataubut and the seasonal, ancestral home of the 
         Massachusett, Wampanoag, and Pokanoket tribes. The descendants of the Neponset Band of the 
         Massachusett Tribe, the Ponkapoag people, inhabited the future site of the town before and 
         during the first recording of the colonization of the area on September 30, 1621 under Captain 
         Myles Standish of the Plymouth Colony. Quincy's present-day neighborhood of Wollaston paralleled 
         colonial expansion in the area and developed as a European settlement after Thomas Morton, Captain 
         Richard Wollaston, and a group of colonists parted with the Plymouth Colony as early as 1624.</p>
      <p>On September 23, 1874, a meeting was called for the organization of a Congregational church
        in Wollaston, Quincy, Massachusetts. The resulting Wollaston Congregational Society met in
        local churches and member residences until the completion of the first meeting house, which
        was erected in 1875 and dedicated in 1876. Reverend Francis N. Zabriskee, D.D., acted as
        first regular pastor. The church was constructed on the corner lot between Lincoln Avenue
        and Winthrop Avenue in Quincy, Massachusetts in the neighborhood then known as Wollaston
        Heights. Specifications for the wooden Gothic Revival were made by architect Samuel D. Kelly
        of Boston with J.D. Rollins and D. R. Edgerton of Edgarton &amp; Rollins contracted to
        complete the building on or before January 1, 1876. Wollaston Congregational Church was
        incorporated on November 15, 1898, effectively dissolving the Wollaston Congregational
        Society.</p>
      <p>The Wollaston Congregational Church an acquired additional, neighboring property in 1900. A
        new parish house was built and dedicated on November 14, 1915. Discussions regarding the
        potential of a new meeting house arose in 1923 to accommodate increased membership. The
        eventual construction of a new meeting house began in 1925. The corner stone was laid on
        June 14 of the same year, and the building was dedicated on March 28, 1926.</p>
      <p>The Wollaston Congregational Church maintained several auxiliary groups throughout its
        history. A meeting was held on February 17, 1875 for the organization Ladies Benevolent
        Society. The society outlined its constitution and bylaws on February 26, 1875. The
        Auxiliary to the Women's Board of Missions was organized in 1887 and merged with the Ladies
        Benevolent Society in May 1918 to form the Women's Union. Also included is the
        Congregational Men's Club, which was started in 1906 and renamed the Chester I. Campbell
        Men's Club in 1933.</p>
      <p>Wollaston Congregational Church voted to join the United Church of Christ on January 29,
        1960 and is still active today.</p>
