      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Thomas Weld was born in November, 1702, in Roxbury, Massachusetts. He graduated from
        Harvard University in 1723. Weld first became a teacher at the Roxbury Latin School before
        moving to Southborough to preach. In 1735 he was invited to preach at the newly gathered
        Congregational Church in Upton, Massachusetts and he was ordained as the first minister of
        the church on January 4, 1738. He was dismissed from his position in December, 1743 due to
        theological differences between himself and his parish. In addition, there were rumors that
        Rev. Weld had had an extramarital relationship with the daughter of his landlord, Ms.
        Wheeler.</p>
      <p>In 1744, Weld was called to preach in Middleboro, Massachusetts following the death of Rev.
        Peter Thatcher, Jr. His appointment as the minister in 1745 followed a split in the church,
        between revivalists and traditionalist, with the majority of the congregation staying with
        Rev. Weld and the minority forming a break-away church with Rev. Sylvanus Conant as their
        minister. During Rev. Weld's ministry, the congregation shrank significantly, with most
        leaving to join Rev. Conant's church. In 1749 Weld was dismissed; following Weld's dismissal
        the church reformed with Conant's.</p>
      <p>Weld returned to Roxbury and pursued a suit against Middleboro for salary. He evidentially
        won that suit. In the following years Ward likely became an itinerant preacher before
        joining the British Army as a chaplain during the French and Indian War (1754-1763). He died
        during the war, probably in the range of 1756-1758.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>This collection contain a commonplace book that was created during Thomas Weld's time at
        Harvard University. The front half of the book contains notes on various subjects and
        topics, mostly of a religious nature. The back half is a small glossary of terms in
        alphabetical order. Of note is that different handwriting appears in the latter half of the
        book; it is presumed that the first half is written in Weld's handwriting. It is unknown who
        else may have written in this book. Most of the text within the volume is English, however,
        there are also some notes written in modern Greek.</p>
