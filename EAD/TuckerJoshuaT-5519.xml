      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Joshua Thomas Tucker (commonly referred to as "J.T. Tucker") was an American minister from
        Massachusetts. He was born on September 20, 1812, to Wealthy Thomas and Joshua Tucker. In
        adulthood, Tucker was ordained by the Presbytery of Alton, Illinois in 1837 and, in that
        same year, married his first wife, Mary Oland Stibbs. Together they had four children. Mary
        died in 1844, and Tucker remarried to Annie Deborah Shackford in 1845, with whom he had one
        son. </p>
      <p>Between 1840 and 1848, Tucker worked and lived in Missouri until being installed as pastor
        at Holliston, Massachusetts in 1849. There, Tucker preached throughout the entirety of the
        American Civil War (1861-1865). His sermons from this time remarked on current events
        surrounding the war, which had begun due to rising tensions between Northern and Southern
        states over slavery and its role as westward expansion of the country increased. Tucker also
        spoke of both the inauguration and assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. </p>
      <p>Having grown up and preached in Massachusetts, J.T. Tucker eventually died there in 1897,
        at the age of 84. </p>
