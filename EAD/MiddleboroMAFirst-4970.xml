        Middleboro was first organized on December 26, 1694 and Samuel Fuller was ordained as the
        first minister. The First meeting house had been constructed previously in 1680 and the
        second was constructed in 1701. Ecclesiastical differences between competing factions
        resulted in the congregation splitting and the third meeting house being constructed in
        1745. The congregation remerged in 1754. The fourth and present meeting house was built in
        1828. The congregation continues to serve the Middleboro community today. The collection
        contains valuable membership records along with administrative records, financial records,
        manuscript sermons, and print materials.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The area of Middleborough was first settled by English colonizers from the Plymouth Colony
        in March 1662 after the purchase of land from the Native American sachem, Wampatuck. The
        settlement was destroyed in 1675 during the King Phillips War. It was resettled in 1679.
        Among the new group of settlers was Samuel Fuller, son of Dr. Samuel Fuller of the
        Mayflower, who acted as minister for the new settlement. The first meetinghouse was
        constructed in 1680. The First Congregational Church in Middleboro, also referred to as the
        First Church of Christ, was organized on December 26, 1694 (O.S.) and Fuller was ordained
        the same day. Fuller died the following summer.</p>
      <p>The second meetinghouse was constructed in 1701 and the First was auctioned off shortly
        after. Rev. Peter Thacher oversaw a revival movement during his ministry which ended with
        his death in 1744. Following his death, ecclesiastical differences between the "standing
        party" and the "revival men" resulted in a split in the congregation. The "standing party"
        maintained the majority of the congregation and the second meetinghouse. This group called
        Rev. Thomas Weld to be their pastor. The "revival men" built a third meetinghouse in 1745
        and called Sylvanus Conant as their pastor. In 1746, George Whitefield preached from the
        third meetinghouse and tradition holds that the building was so crowded that Whitefield
        could only leave by climbing out a window behind the pulpit. The church reunified in 1749
        after the dismission of Weld.</p>
      <p>The fourth, and current, meeting house was built in 1828 and designed by the architect,
        James Sproat. Sproat had joined the church in 1816 and he later became a deacon in 1833. The
        building was dedicated in 1829 and the dedication sermon was preached by Rev. Lyman Beecher.
        The church largely saw growth during the nineteenth-century.</p>
      <p>After the General Council of Congregational Churches voted to merge with the Evangelical
        and Reformed Church to form the United Church of Christ in 1957, the First Congregational
        Church in Middleboro decided to instead join the National Association of Congregational
        Christian Churches. The first half of the twentieth-century also saw declining church
        membership. Membership grew after the ordination of Manfred Kohl in 1969. In 1993, the
        church also joined the Conservative Congregational Christian Conference. The church
        continues to serve the Middleboro community today.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>This collection of records from the First Congregational Church in Middleboro,
        Massachusetts, documents the administrative history of the church and the religious life of
        its members. The membership records within the collection are particularly robust and
        include hundreds of individual's relations, marriage intentions, membership requests and
        dismissions, and disciplinary records. The collection includes administrative and financial
        records, including meeting minutes, committee reports, ecclesiastical council results,
        receipts, and pew records. The collection also includes manuscript sermons, the majority
        written by Sylvanus Conant, and some print materials related to the history of the
        church.</p>

          <p>This series contains the church's membership records, which are largely composed of
            relations. Relations are written accounts of individuals' religious experience, often
            required in the process of applying for full membership. Many of the relations in this
            series are written in the congregants' own handwriting. The relations also includes
            related membership records, such as letters of transfer to and from other churches,
            requests for baptism, and confessions of sins written in order to return to the good
            graces of the church. In addition to relations, this series contains marriage
            intentions, which were recorded by the town clerk prior to marriage, membership
            requests, letters of dismission, disciplinary records, including testimony, and
            membership certificates to various religious societies.</p>
