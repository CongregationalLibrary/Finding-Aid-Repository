      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Rev. David Avery (1746-1817) was born in Franklin, Connecticut. He graduated from Yale in
        1769, studied theology at Dartmouth College, and was ordained as a missionary to the Native
        Americans in 1771. After serving as an army chaplain during the Revolutionary War, he was
        installed as the pastor in Bennington, Vermont in 1780. He moved to Wrentham, Massachusetts
        in 1783 to replace the minister of the First Church in Wrentham, who had died in office.
        While at Wrentham, Rev. Avery had an increasing number of difficulties with his
        parishioners, largely over his strict adherence to disciplinary rules, and he was eventually
        dismissed from his service in Wrentham in 1794. From there he moved back to Connecticut and
        served the church in Union for a few years before resuming his missionary work. He died of
        typhus fever at age 71.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>This collection contains a manuscript volume prepared by Rev. David Avery, and sent to
        David Howell, Esq. "for his judgment &amp; advice," about the strife that had grown between
        Avery and his congregation. The base of the disagreement was how matters of church
        discipline should be addressed; While Avery adhered strictly to the procedure set out in the
        book of Matthew, a group of members wanted a more flexible system. In this manuscript, Avery
        details a series of conversations and interventions that the led to his eventual break with
        the church.</p>
