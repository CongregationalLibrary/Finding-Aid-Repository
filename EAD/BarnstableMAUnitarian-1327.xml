      <abstract id="aspace_36411dff916c517caa9681ee95521d50">The East Parish Church in Barnstable
        was officially gathered in 1723 after the town of Barnstable was split into East and West
        Parishes in 1717. In 1836 the original meeting house was replaced by a new structure. This
        meeting house was destroyed by fire in 1905; construction on the third and final meeting
        house was completed in 1907. During the nineteenth-century the church joined the Unitarian
        movement and became the Barnstable Unitarian Church. The church continues to serve the local
        community today. This collection contains the earliest records of East Parish Church in
        Barnstable, as well as the early records of the Barnstable Unitarian Church, and includes
        meeting minutes, vital records, ecclesiastical council results, and records of church
        discipline.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>In 1717 the town of Barnstable voted to split the town into two parishes each served by
        their own church. The West Parish became the successor of the original church in Barnstable
        whose history traced back to London in 1616. The East Parish was officially gathered in 1723
        as a new church. The first meeting house of the East Parish Church was built on Cobb Hill.
        In 1836 the meeting house was removed and that same year construction on the second meeting
        house was completed. At some point in the nineteenth-century, probably 1845, the East Parish
        Church became Unitarian and was renamed as the Barnstable Unitarian Church.</p>
      <p>In 1905 the second meeting house was destroyed in a fire. Construction on the third, and
        final, meeting house was completed in 1907. In 1960, the Parish Hall, a major extension of
        the church, was completed. Another addition to the building was constructed in 1979.</p>
      <p>The Unitarian Church of Barnstable, now affiliated with the Unitarian Universalist
        Association, continues to serve the local community today.</p>
