      <abstract>The New North Church in Boston was established in 1712 in the North End of Boston
        and the first church building was completed in 1714. John Webb was ordained as the first
        pastor in 1714. A disagreement over ordaining Peter Thacher as the second minister in 1720
        resulted in the formation of the New Brick Church in 1722. The second church building was
        designed by Charles Bulfinch and completed in 1804. In 1862, the New North Church sold their
        church building to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Boston. The church building was renamed St.
        Stephen's Church and remains a Catholic church today. Around 1867, the New North Church
        merged with the Bulfinch Street Church and between 1884 and 1886 this merged church ceased
        to operate. This collection contains a single manuscript pamphlet that records information
        about various sermons delivered at the New North Church between August and November of
        1722.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The New North Church in Boston was established in 1712 in the North End of Boston by
        members of the Old North Church. The first church building for the New North Church was
        completed in 1714. John Webb was ordained as the first pastor of the New North Church on
        October 20, 1714. In 1720, John Webb desired to settle Peter Thacher as the next minister of
        the New North Church. Nearly half of the congregation disagreed with the choice which
        ultimately resulted in many withdrawing to form the New Brick Church in 1722. During
        Thacher's ministry the church building was expanded in 1730.</p>
      <p>Andrew Eliot was ordained as the third pastor of the New North Church on April 14, 1743.
        During the English occupation of Boston, Eliot labored to keep the New North Church open for
        worship, though he was separated from his family during that time. His pastorate ended with
        his death om September 13, 1778. Eliot's son, John Eliot was chosen to be the next pastor
        and was ordained on November 3, 1779. During John Eliot's pastorate a new church building
        was built between 1802 and 1804. This new building was designed by Charles Bulfinch, a noted
        architect in both Boston and Washington, D.C. The building, which still stands today, was
        added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. John Eliot's pastorate also ended
        with his death on February 14, 1813.</p>
      <p>Francis Parkman was ordained as pastor of the New North Church on December 8, 1813. The
        ordination of Francis Parkman also marked the transition of the New North Church from a
        Congregationalist Church to a Unitarian Church. Parkman served as pastor of the church until
        he resigned on January 28, 1849. Joshua Young succeeded Parkman and was ordained on February
        1, 1849. He resigned in July, 1852. Arthur B. Fuller succeeded Young and began his ministry
        on June 1, 1853.</p>
      <p>In 1862 the New North Church, owing largely to the influx of Irish Catholics into the North
        End, sold their church building to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Boston. The building was
        renamed St. Stephen's Church. Today, St. Stephen's Church is home to the Missionary Society
        of St. James the Apostle and in 1992 the church became a part of St. Leonard of Port Maurice
        Parish. St. Stephen's Church continues to hold weekly worship services.</p>
      <p>Somewhere around 1867, the New North Church merged with the Bulfinch Street Church, another
        Unitarian Church in Boston. This newly merged church apparently ceased to operate sometime
        between 1884 and 1886.</p>
