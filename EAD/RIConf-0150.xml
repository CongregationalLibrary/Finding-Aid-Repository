      <abstract>The Rhode Island Domestic Missionary Society was formed in 1802 and the Evangelical
        Consociation of Congregational Churches was formed in 1806. The two entities merged in 1912
        as the Rhode Island Congregational Conference. The Rhode Island Congregational Conference
        merged with the Rhode Island and Massachusetts Christian Conference in 1931 to form the
        Rhode Island Congregational Christian Conference. After the formation of the United Church
        of Christ, the conference was known as the Rhode Island Conference of the United Church of
        Christ. In 2020, the Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Massachusetts Conferences merged to form
        the Southern New England Conference of the United Church of Christ. This collection contains
        the records of the Rhode Island Conference of the United Church of Christ and its
        predecessor organization and includes meeting minutes, board records, reports, programs and
        brochures, newsletters, communications, and legal records.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The organization of Congregationalists into a single statewide entity in Rhode Island began
        in 1802 with the formation of the Rhode Island Domestic Missionary Society. This group was
        closely followed up with the formation of the Evangelical Consociation of Congregational
        Churches in 1806. The first of these two groups became the Rhode Island Home Missionary
        Society in 1849 and became a centralized administrative group focused on the needs of
        Congregationalists within Rhode Island. The later of the two groups, which had a few names,
        but most prominently settled on the Rhode Island Congregational Conference, was initially
        formed to promote fellowship and communication between the ordained Congregational clergy of
        Rhode Island. The two organizations formally united as a single entity in 1912 while
        retaining the name Rhode Island Congregational Conference.</p>
      <p>The Christians in Rhode Island largely belonged to one of two different conferences
        throughout the 19th century. The Connecticut Christian Conference was formed in 1821 and
        then in 1834 became the Rhode Island and Connecticut Christian Conference. The Rhode Island
        and Massachusetts Christian Conference, formed in 1837, separated from the Massachusetts
        Christian Conference to form an explicitly anti-slavery Christian Conference. The Rhode
        Island and Connecticut Christian Conference merged into the Rhode Island and Massachusetts
        Christian Conference in 1875. When the national Congregational and Christian organizations
        merged together in 1931, the Rhode Island and Massachusetts Christian Conference merged with
        the Rhode Island Congregational Conference to form the Rhode Island Congregational Christian
        Conference.</p>
      <p>After the formation of the United Church of Christ in 1957, the Rhode Island Congregational
        Christian Conference became known as the Rhode Island Congregational Conference (United
        Church of Christ) after the Constitution was amended in 1963. Eventually, the name would
        become the Rhode Island Conference of the United Church of Christ.</p>
      <p>A proposal for the Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Massachusetts Conferences of the United
        Church of Christ to merge was initially submitted in 2016. On January 1, 2020, the Southern
        New England Conference of the United Church of Christ was formed out of the merger of those
        three statewide conferences. Offices for the Historic Rhode Island Conference were
        subsequently closed and by 2025 the papers and records of the conference were appropriately
        disbursed to various organizations.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>This collection contains the records of the Rhode Island Conference of the United Church of
        Christ. The collection is primarily administrative in nature and includes records, minutes,
        reports, financial records, board records, annual reports, and correspondence that speak to
        the day-to-day running of the conference. The collection also contains records of
        predecessor organizations, most prominently, the Rhode Island and Massachusetts Christian
        Conference, the Rhode Island and Connecticut Christian Conference, and the Rhode Island Home
        Missionary Society. The collection also contains records related to the programs, task
        forces, and committees that the conference promoted and supported throughout its history. A
        sizable portion of the collection are communications and legal records related to individual
        Congregational and Christian churches within Rhode Island and their ministers.</p>

      <head>Arrangement</head>
      <p>Materials in this collection have been arranged into the four series listed below. The
        Conference records series has been further divided into seven topical subseries to support
        the accessibility of the materials. Materials within most series and subseries have been
        further arranged into chronological order by start date. Materials within the Church
        communications and records series and the Conference programs and task forces series have
        been arranged according to chronological order to mimic how these materials were originally
        filed, or intended to be filed, by the original record keepers.</p>

          <p>This series contains records relating to various Congregational Churches in Rhode
            Island. The majority of the records are either direct communications between the
            conference and the individual churches and/or records related to church properties.
            Another large portion of the records are related to the hiring of ministers and the
            completion of church profiles as part of the hiring process. The series also contains
            various records and documents the churches sent to the conference over the course of
            their histories.</p>

          <p>This series contains the programmatic records of the Rhode Island Conference. The
            majority of the records in the series relate to either programs and events sponsored
            and/or run by the conference and its staff or to task forces convened by the conference.
            These programmatic records describe in detail the wide variety of activities the
            conference sponsored throughout its history, especially during the 20th century. The
            records also show a growing interest in social justice issues throughout the century.
            The records include meeting minutes and communications from task forces, brochures and
            programs, event flyers, newsletters, and correspondence.</p>
