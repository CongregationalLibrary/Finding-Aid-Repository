      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The Trinity Congregational Church was gathered in 1894. Construction on the first church
        building was begun in 1895 and was located at Cedar Avenue at East 84th Street in Cleveland,
        Ohio. Construction of the church was completed in 1896 and the building was dedicated that
        same year. The community changed after World War I and the church building was sold with the
        intent of building a new building in Cleveland Heights. By 1927, land was purchased at
        Washington Boulevard at Thayne Road and construction of a new building was begun. The
        building was dedicated on Easter Sunday in 1928. The church struggled financially throughout
        World War II and by 1945 the neighborhood in Cleveland Heights had become majority Jewish.
        In 1946, the church building was sold to the Community Temple. In 1947, land for a new
        church building was purchased at Brainard Circle, Gates Mills Boulevard and Shaker Boulevard
        in Pepper Pike. Construction on the new building began in 1951 and was completed in 1952. A
        new wing for the church building was constructed between 1956 and 1957. The church was
        dissolved in 1983 and some proceeds from the sale of the church building were given to Faith
        United Church of Christ in Richmond Heights. 30 members of the church, as well as some of
        the church records, also went to the Faith United Church of Christ.</p>
