      <abstract>The First Parish Church was founded in 1751 shortly after the incorporation of the
        town of Medfield. Rev. John Wilson was the first pastor. A second meeting house was
        constructed in 1706. The third and current meetinghouse was built in 1789. In 1813 the town
        and the parish were legally separated with members of the church incorporated as The First
        Parish. In 1827 a group of members of the First Parish petitioned for permission to withdraw
        from the First Parish, which was becoming increasingly Unitarian, in order to form an
        Orthodox church. The original First Parish church was subsequently known as the First Parish
        Unitarian church. The records of the First Parish Church include both church administrative
        documentation and some personal records such as legal and financial materials.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The First Parish Church dates back to the beginning of the town of Medfield in 1649, in
        which settlers from Dedham and Braintree, Mass. requested the incorporation of a new town by
        the General Court which was subsequently granted in May of 1651. They founded the Medfield
        Church of Christ in the same year, calling Rev. John Wilson as their first pastor.</p>
      <p>The second minister was Rev. Joseph Baxter, a Harvard graduate and native of Braintree,
        Massachusetts, who served from 1697-1745. During his ministry the church membership grew
        from 65 to 375, and a second meeting house was constructed in 1706.</p>
      <p>During the pastorate of the fourth minister Rev. Thomas Prentiss, which lasted from
        1770-1814, a third meetinghouse was built, dating to 1789. As of 2019, a heavily remodeled
        version of this building is still standing, and is listed on the National Register of
        Historic Places. The specifications for the wooden frame of the building are given in detail
        in the town records and include details of the heavy timbers used in construction, which
        were hand hewn oak measuring 14 inches square. The building's tower was 52 feet high and
        surmounted by a belfry and cupola. In 1809 the inside of the church was refurbished, with
        seats in the body of the meeting house being taken up and replaced with pews, as well as the
        creation of a segregated gallery seating area for non-white parishioners.</p>
      <p>In 1813 the town and the parish began to be legally separated. The members of the church
        incorporated as The First Parish. In 1816 the trustees of the Medfield Ministerial Fund,
        Inc. were granted a charter and by-laws by the General Court. The first Sunday school was
        organized in 1818, officiated entirely by women, with the wife of Rev. Thomas Prentiss
        playing an active role in its administration.</p>
      <p>In 1827 a group of members of the First Parish petitioned for permission to withdraw from
        the First Parish, which was becoming increasingly Unitarian, in order to form an Orthodox
        church. An ecclesiastical council was called and granted their request. The Orthodox Church
        of Medfield was organized officially on February 6, 1828 with 17 total members, and is still
        active today as the United Church of Christ in Medfield.</p>
      <p>The original First Parish church was subsequently known as the First Parish Unitarian
        church from 1828 onwards. The meeting house was extensively remodeled again in 1839,
        including a complete reorientation of the front of the building from east to south, and the
        construction of a larger spire. During the hurricane of 1938, the taller spire which had
        been added when the building was remodeled in 1839 was destroyed, and remains
        un-replaced.</p>
      <p>By the 1970s the congregation had diminished to 10 members and was in danger of
        dissolution. Growth increased in the following decades, however, to the extent that the
        Unitarian Universalist Association granted the church an award in recognition of their
        revitalization. The church continues to serve the Medfield community today.</p>

      <p>The records of the First Parish Church in Medfield include a broad array of both church
        administrative documentation and some personal records such as legal and financial
        materials. There is a single bound volume of church records dating from 1738-1880. Other
        administrative documentation includes a folder of loose records found inside the volume,
        official church correspondence, membership records, meeting minutes, relations, and a
        collection of 17th-18th century prayer requests. Also included are records relating to the
        ministry, including correspondence from ministers, and a volume of sermons spanning several
        decades from the 1740s-1780s. Personal records include legal and financial records, and a
        single item of personal correspondence regarding provisions for a ship. Additionally, a
        small volume of printed materials consisting of a 19th-century order of service and a
        newspaper cutting from 1970 detailing preservation of the colonial-era relation of faith
        documents within the collection.</p>
