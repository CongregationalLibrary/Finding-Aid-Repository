      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>John Rogers, the son of Rev. John Rogers, the fifth president of Harvard College, was born
        on July 7, 1666. He graduated from Harvard College in 1684 and soon after began to teach at
        the Ipswich grammar school. He married Martha Whittingham on Mar. 4, 1691, in Ipswich. They
        had 10 children together. In October of 1692, he was ordained as the junior minister of the
        First Church in Ipswich, working under his uncle, Rev. William Hubbard. In 1702 Rev. Hubbard
        fell ill and John Rogers took over Hubbard's ministerial duties completely. After Rev.
        Hubbard's death in 1704, the parish accepted John Rogers as their next minister. He was an
        acquaintance of John Wise, minister of the Chebacco Parish and early protester against
        British taxation of the colonies. In 1714 the two families were united by the marriage of
        John Wise Jr. and Mary Rogers. John Rogers continued to serve as minister of the First
        Church in Ipswich until his death on December 28, 1745. His funeral was paid for by the
        parish in honor of his long service to the church.</p>

          <p>This proposal, dated June 14, 1714, was written by John Wise, to John Rogers, about
            beginning a formal courtship between John Wise Jr. and Mary Rogers. The letter is
            complimentary towards John Rogers and his family, and offers suggestions how a union
            between John and Mary might benefit the families involved. Evidently the courtship went
            forward as Mary and John were married four months later on October 23, 1714.</p>
