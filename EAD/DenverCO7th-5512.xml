      <abstract>The Villa Park Congregational Church was organized, with the help of Rev. George
        Rose, in 1890 and construction on the first church building was completed by October of that
        year. In 1913, land was purchased at the intersection of West Seventh Avenue and King
        Street, in the Barnum neighborhood, for the purpose of constructing a new church building.
        That same year, the church formally voted to become the Seventh Avenue Congregational
        Church. The church struggled to flourish in the following decades. While the church grew in
        the wake of World War II, demographic and economic changes in West Denver negatively
        affected church membership after the 1960s. The church joined with the United Church of
        Christ in 1957. The church continued to serve its community through 2016 when the church
        building was sold to Church of the Advent. This collection contains records related to the
        history, activities, and administrations of the church and its members. A significant
        portion of the collection is three historical scrapbooks which document the history of the
        church through documents, clippings, and photographs.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>Congregationalists first began to gather and worship together within the Villa Park
        neighborhood in Denver in 1884. These Congregationalists gathered in people's homes rather
        than a formal church. The Villa Park Congregational Church was formally organized, with the
        help of Rev. George Rose, in 1890 and plans were immediately put into place to build a
        church building. Construction on that building was completed by October, 1890, and Rev.
        Chester Clark oversaw the dedication service for the new church. The church's membership
        steadily grew as the Villa Park, Barnum, and West Barnum neighborhoods slowly developed. By
        1912, shortly after Rev. Robert Allingham was installed pastor, a committee was set up to
        investigate plans for a new, larger, church building. In 1913, land was purchased at the
        intersection of West Seventh Avenue and King Street, in the Barnum neighborhood, and the
        church formally voted to become the Seventh Avenue Congregational Church. The dedication
        service for the new church building was held on September 7, 1913.</p>
      <p>The church struggled to flourish in the following decades and membership waxed and waned.
        In 1946, the church purchased and installed a Hammond organ. The church's Women's
        Association, a successor to the Ladies Aid Society which had been active within the church
        since the beginning, was formed in 1948; by around 1952 it had become the Women's
        Fellowship. The church was also legally incorporated in 1948. The church saw increased
        membership and activity during the late 40s and into the 50s. However, much of that growth
        faltered in the 60s due to economic and demographic changes in West Denver. The church
        joined with the United Church of Christ in 1957. Between 1967 and 1972, a new parsonage was
        constructed.</p>
      <p>The church continued to serve its community through 2016 when the church building was sold
        to Church of the Advent.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>This collection contains records related to the history and activities of the Seventh
        Avenue Congregational Church, originally the Villa Park Congregational Church. The church
        records include meeting minutes, baptismal records, and membership records while the
        trustee's records contain meeting minutes, often relating to financial matters. The records
        of the Ladies' Cooperative Guild and Women's Fellowship document the activities of the women
        who supported the church. The collection also contains three historical scrapbooks which
        document the history of the church through documents, clippings, and photographs.</p>
