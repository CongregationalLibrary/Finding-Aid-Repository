      <abstract>The Boston Ministers' Meeting was a gathering of Congregational pastors and acting
        pastors in the Boston, MA area. The meetings were meant to facilitate fellowship among
        Congregational ministers through discussions, presentations, and prayer, and were held
        regularly from April 1868 until their formal end in 1951. The collection consists of six
        volumes of meeting minutes from the Ministers' Meetings with some inclusion of the meeting's
        by-laws, member lists, correspondence, and publications either written or inserted into the
        related volume.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The Boston Ministers' Meeting began April 6, 1868 with a group of Congregational pastors
        and acting pastors in Boston and the surrounding areas of Massachusetts. They first met at
        the Congregational Library Association and regular meetings were held at Pilgrim Hall at 14
        Beacon St. in Boston. Their meetings were held weekly on Mondays from September or October
        until April or May. In the later years, the meeting were held monthly on the first Monday of
        the month. The organization was meant to facilitate and promote fellowship among
        Congregational ministers. The meetings consisted of discussions between members,
        presentations from speakers, prayer and occasionally music. During the 1940s, interest began
        to decline along with membership and attendance. In October 1951, the Boston Ministers'
        Meeting formally ended due to a lack of interest in gathering together from the
        Congregational ministers in the area. The remaining records and treasury were given to Rev.
        Myron Fowell in November 1951.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>The collection consists of six volumes and one folder of loose materials dating from 1868 –
        1951. There is a gap between 1913 – 1917 with no records from those years. There are smaller
        time skips from when the Boston Ministers' Meetings were on a break in the summer or chose
        to cancel or move their meetings. The volumes are mostly handwritten meeting minutes from
        the regular meetings held by the Boston Ministers' Meeting along with the standing rules of
        the organization and member lists for certain years. The handwriting changes regularly
        throughout the volumes die to annual elections of a new secretary who was responsible for
        recording the meeting minutes. There are additional materials inserted into the volumes that
        relate to the organization or to the topic discussed during a meeting. The additional
        materials are a mix of handwritten and typed papers that include correspondence, newspaper
        clippings, pamphlets, advertisements or other papers of interest to the current author. Some
        of the additional materials have been pasted onto pages of the volumes or attached by paper
        clip. Other materials have no attachment to the pages and are loosely inserted between two
        pages. The majority of the additional materials have been left alone in the volumes they
        were inserted into. The loose materials in the 1898-1908 volume have been removed due to the
        comparatively large quantity of them and preservation concerns over potential damage from
        metal attachments or folded creases. The removed loose materials have been placed in a
        separate folder in the order they were removed from the volume.</p>
