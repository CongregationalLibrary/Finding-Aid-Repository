      <abstract id="aspace_7dab34cd51bc3a9f29fa15aa0651664e">The First Congregational Church in
        Hopkinton was organized in 1724, shortly after the establishment of the town of Hopkinton by
        Harvard College, who had purchased the land from a local community of "praying Indians".
        Five versions of the meeting house have existed, two of which were destroyed, first by fire
        in 1882 and then by a hurricane in 1939. In September 2011 the name of the church was
        officially changed to Faith Community Church. This collection includes the earliest records
        of the church, including meeting minutes, financial reports, listings of marriages,
        baptisms, deaths, and dismissions, and relations of faith.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The area that now comprises the towns of Hopkinton and Ashland was once known as
        Magwonkkommok (or Magunco), and consisted of 51 families of "praying Indians", Christianized
        Native residents probably drawn from the Massachusett and Nipmuc tribes indigenous to the
        area. This community was the seventh such "praying town" established by the English Puritan
        missionary Rev. John Eliot. Harvard College subsequently purchased the land from the Native
        residents in 1715, renaming it Hopkinton after Edward Hopkins, a major benefactor of the
        college. Harvard then proceeded to lease the land for 3 cents per acre.</p>
      <p>On May 21, 1723, the town voted "to have preaching constantly on the Sabbath." A church,
        initially composed of 15 members, was organized in September of 1724. They simultaneously
        ordained the Rev. Samuel Barrett, a graduate of Harvard, as their first minister. A simple
        two-story meeting house, measuring 48x38, was constructed in 1725. In 1731 the church voted
        to observe the Cambridge Platform of Church Discipline, adopting a congregational form of
        governance.</p>
      <p>Rev. Barrett remained as pastor until his death in 1772, at which time his colleague Rev.
        Elijah Fitch took over the ministry until his own death in 1788. In 1791 the Rev. Nathaniel
        Howe was ordained, although as a condition of his ordination he specified that he would not
        personally admit members to the church under the Half-Way covenant. He preached a famous
        "Century Sermon" in 1815 to commemorate the centenary of the town, which was subsequently
        published worldwide.</p>
      <p>The parish was officially incorporated in 1827, the town having managed the church before
        that time. The parish committee quickly voted to build a new meeting house, and the first
        building was sold and moved off-site. The second meeting house was finished and dedicated in
        January of 1830, measuring 50x62 feet, with a seating capacity of 600 in the main
        auditorium. It also included a steeple and bell. An organ was installed at a cost of $600 in
        1847. This second church was extensively remodeled and enlarged in 1859, when Hopkinton's
        population grew to 4,500 as a result of the town's success as a center of boot and shoe
        manufacturing. The organ and bell were also replaced with larger versions, and a parsonage
        was purchased in 1870 at a cost of $3,500.</p>
      <p>In 1882, a fire swept through Hopkinton, destroying the second meeting house, along with
        the town hall, post office, a hotel, and a shoe factory. Funds were quickly raised for the
        construction of a new and third meeting house, costing a total of $31,000, which was
        dedicated in May of the following year. This building was also the victim of a cataclysmic
        event, when the hurricane of September 21, 1938 toppled the steeple and effectively
        destroyed the entire church. Consequently, a fourth iteration of the meeting house was built
        in 1939. The large former bell, salvaged from the third meeting house, was installed in the
        new church and was rung at its dedication.</p>
      <p>The church eventually affiliated with the United Church of Christ, but voted to leave on
        October 2, 1994 due to theological differences. In 1997, the current church building was
        constructed in order to accommodate expanding membership. In September 2011 the name of the
        church was officially changed to Faith Community Church.</p>

          <p>This single document is a petition by six signatories requesting reconciliation with
            disaffected members of the church. The dispute arose over differences of opinion
            regarding the administration of the Lord's Supper (Communion). The document is dated May
            4, 1747.</p>
