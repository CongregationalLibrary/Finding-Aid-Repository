      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The town of Stoneham, previously known as Charlestown End, was incorporated in 1725. A vote
        in 1726 provided for the building of a 1,440-square-foot meetinghouse however the First
        Congregational Church itself was not organized until July 1729, with thirteen founding
        members, when the first church covenant was read and adopted. The first pastor was Rev.
        James Osgood, a 24 year old Harvard graduate from Salem, who was called in October 1728, and
        ordained in September 1729. Osgood served until his death in 1746 and was replaced by John
        Carnes, who was dismissed from his position in 1757. John Searl succeeded Carnes in 1758,
        followed by the ordination of John Cleaveland Jr. in 1785.</p>
      <p>Rev. John Cleaveland Jr. was the son of Rev. John Cleveland of Essex, a separatist minister
        who served as a chaplain in the French and Indian War and the American Revolution.
        Cleaveland Jr., unable to pay for a college education, was instead taught by his father. His
        pastorate at Stoneham was his first ministry. Cleaveland's ministry began amicably. With the
        opening of the Stoneham Circulating Library, which was kept at the parsonage, Cleaveland
        became the town's first librarian. Cleaveland's relationship with the church's members
        remained favorable until the passing of his wife in 1793. Following his wife's death,
        Cleaveland married Elizabeth Evans, his housekeeper. The reaction to this marriage was
        negative; at various times Cleaveland found the door to the meeting house nailed shut, the
        seat of the pulpit covered in tar, and the tail of his horse cut off. While the church
        itself supported Cleaveland, the town consistently did not, refusing to raise his salary and
        going so far as to shutter the meeting house so that public worship could not be held there.
        An ecclesiastical council called late September 1794 dissolved Cleaveland's relationship
        with the town and church.</p>
      <p>Several pastors were called after Cleaveland, and in 1803 the town voted for the
        construction of a new, larger, meetinghouse. A bell for the new meetinghouse's belfry was
        purchased in 1810 with money raised through subscription, and a Sabbath-school was
        established in 1816. The second meetinghouse burned to the ground in 1840. That same year,
        at the cost of $5,500, the third, and final, meeting house was constructed. An example of
        Greek Revival architecture, the third meeting house was added to the National Register of
        Historic Places in 1984.</p>
      <p>The First Congregational Church in Stoneham, UCC, continues to serve the local community
        today.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>This collection contains the early records of First Congregational Church in Stoneham,
        Massachusetts. Included in this collection are church records of meeting minutes, vital
        statistics, and membership rolls; parish and financial records, including salary and capital
        expenses; and documents created by ministers who served the church, including commonplace
        and account books from James Osgood, and sermons from an unnamed minister, most likely John
        Stevens who served in both Stoneham and Haverhill. Of particular note is the Osgood family's
        account book which contains not only the accounts of Rev. James Osgood, but also records of
        his wife, Sarah Osgood's, household and other expenses.</p>
