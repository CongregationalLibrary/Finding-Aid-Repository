      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The First Church of Danvers was founded in 1672 when a group of farmers who lived quite a
        distance from the Salem meetinghouse of which they were members petitioned for permission to
        erect one of their own. After initially being denied, the Massachusetts Court granted
        permission for a meetinghouse to be established in what was then known as Salem Village, and
        for the gathered body to call a minister.</p>
      <p>This collection contains records from the years 1672-1845. During that time, the First
        Church became the epicenter of the Salem witchcraft hysteria, built four meetinghouses, was
        instrumental in the establishment and building of the village's first school, saw Danvers
        incorporated as its own town, and survived the Revolutionary War while at the same time
        contributing numerous officers and soldiers to the cause. The church folded in 2016 and
        transformed into Disciples, United Church of Christ Danvers.</p>
