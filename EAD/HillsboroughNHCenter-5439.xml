      <abstract>The Congregational Society in Hillsborough, New Hampshire, was first organized and
        began convening in its first meeting house in 1769. Over the next two decades, the society
        constructed two more meeting houses. Its third meeting house served the community until
        1839, when a group of church members withdrew to form their own congregation and build their
        own meeting house, a fourth, in Bridge Village. After the split in the community and the
        construction of the fourth Bridge Village meeting house in 1839, the third meeting house
        ceased to serve as a house of worship and was finally abandoned in 1874. Efforts were
        underway in the late 1880s and early 1890s to restore the third building, but it burned down
        in a fire in 1892. After the fire, the efforts that had been directed at restoring the third
        building were redirected instead into the construction of a new fifth church building, which
        was ultimately dedicated in 1893. This fifth building served the Congregational Society
        until the 1920s, when its doors closed. In 1935, though, some community members spearheaded
        an effort to reopen the church for summer services. The society continues to this day to
        hold Sunday services during the summer. This collection contains records of the society,
        including vital records, financial records, building records, cemetery records, records of
        meetings and events, records of the Junior Society of Christian Endeavor, pulpit supply
        records, orders of worship, incorporation documents, and correspondence.</abstract>

      <p>The Congregational Society in Hillsborough, New Hampshire, was first organized and began
        convening in its first meeting house in 1769. On November 24, 1772, the town appointed the
        Rev. Jonathan Barns to take oversight over the church's meetings in the town, and several
        months later, on May 25, 1773, the annual town meeting called for the erection of a second
        meeting house. That construction was completed around 1779 on a hill southeast of the
        Hillsborough town center, which came to be known as "Meeting House Hill." When the
        congregation outgrew that building, they constructed a third, larger meeting house. The
        building of the third meeting house began in 1789 and was finished in about three years. The
        Rev. Jonathan Barnes continued to serve as minister for the congregation until 1803, when he
        was struck by lightning while horseback riding. He died as a result of his accident in
        1805.</p>
      <p>The third meeting house served the community until 1839, when a group of church members
        withdrew to form their own congregation and build their own meeting house, a fourth, in
        Bridge Village, closer to where those members were living. That community initially called
        itself the Hillsborough Bridge Village Congregational Church but eventually adopted the name
        Smith Memorial Congregational Church, after Governor John B. Smith, who contributed funds to
        the building's renovation in 1909. Smith Memorial continues to meet today and is presently
        affiliated with the United Church of Christ.</p>
      <p>After the split in the church community and the construction of the fourth Bridge Village
        meeting house in 1839, the "Old Meeting House" (the third) ceased to serve as a house of
        worship and instead became a town house used primarily for community meetings. The building
        then became a house of worship for a local Methodist congregation, and it was finally
        abandoned in 1874. Efforts were underway in the late 1880s and early 1890s to restore the
        building, but it burned down in a fire in 1892.</p>
      <p>After the fire, the efforts that had been directed at restoring the third building were
        redirected instead into the construction of a new fifth church building. That building was
        dedicated on August 15, 1893. Records from 1897 to 1909 indicate that this church hosted an
        active Junior Society of Christian Endeavor for its youth. This fifth building served the
        Congregational Society until the 1920s, when its doors closed. In 1935, though, some
        community members expressed a desire for the church to reopen, and repairs on the building
        were undertaken and it was reopened for summer services.</p>
      <p>In 1968, the Hillsborough Center Congregational Society was incorporated, and it celebrated
        its bicentennial in 1969. The society continues to this day to hold Sunday services during
        the summer, relying on supply ministers from throughout the Northeastern United States. The
        society has been maintained by a group of church officers including a clerk, treasurer,
        pulpit supply chairperson, building and grounds chairperson, flower chairperson, and
        cemetery chairperson.</p>
