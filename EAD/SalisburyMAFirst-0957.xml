      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The First Church in Salisbury was formally gathered in 1638. In 1640 the town of Salisbury
        was officially incorporated and construction on the first meeting house was completed. By
        1714, a second population center had formed in the western half of the town. As a result the
        town voted to maintain two churches, each with a settled minister, but also to remain a
        single parish. The Second Church in Salisbury was gathered in 1718 in what is now the Rocky
        Hill section of Amesbury. The First Church also became known as the East Church after 1714.
        In 1725 the second meeting house was constructed to replace the original 1640 structure. In
        1790, the town voted to dismiss the First Church pastor, Edmund Noyes, who was installed in
        1751, and unsuccessfully proceeded to invite candidates to fill his position. Noyes refused
        to recognize his dismissal and continued as pastor at Salisbury until his death in 1809.</p>
      <p>After visits by Jesse Lee and Francis Asbury, there was a growing contingent of Methodists
        within Salisbury during the early nineteenth-century. The Methodists were permitted the use
        of the second meeting house to worship beginning in 1802. In 1811 the First Methodist
        Society was formed. In 1833 the Congregationalists voted to unite with the Methodist Society
        to form the East Parish United Methodist Church. Most members joined the new Methodist
        Congregation while the remaining affiliated with the Congregational churches in Newburyport.
        In 1834 the third and final meeting house was built. The East Parish United Methodist Church
        continues to serve the Salisbury community today.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>This collection contains a legal testimonial regarding a conflict with Rev. Caleb Cushing,
        who was the fourth settled minister of the church, ordained in 1698. The document recounts
        former parishioner Daniel Worster's attempt to seek reconciliation with the church through
        disciplinary action, and Rev. Cushing's denial of the action based on Worster's lapsed
        membership.</p>
