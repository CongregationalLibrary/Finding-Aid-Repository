      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Isaac Watts was born on July 17, 1674. Watts grew up in a nonconformist household and held
        on to those nonconformist beliefs his whole life. As Oxford and Cambridge were open only to
        Anglicans, Watts attended the Dissenting Academy in Stoke Newington. Watts was called to be
        a pastor at the independent chapel, Mark Lane Congregational Chapel, in London. Watts is
        perhaps best known for his prolific hymn writing; he is credited as the author of about 750
        hymns. He also wrote widely read works on theology and logic. Isaac Watts died on November
        25, 1748.</p>
