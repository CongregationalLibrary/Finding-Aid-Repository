      <abstract>The First Church of Christ in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, was first organized in
        February 1764. Thomas Allen was called to be the first minister of the church and he was
        ordained as pastor on April 18, 1764. Construction on the first meeting house was completed
        in 1770 and construction on the second meeting house was completed in 1793. Thomas Allen's
        political beliefs resulted in a schism in 1809 which resulted in the formation of the Second
        Union Church. The churches reunited in 1818 under the pastorate of Dr. Heman Humphrey. In
        1846, black members of the church withdrew to form the Second Congregational Church and in
        1850 another group of members withdrew to form the South Congregational Church. The second
        meeting house was partially destroyed in 1851 and construction was completed on the third
        meeting house in 1853. In 1952, the church underwent a major renovation. The First Church of
        Christ continues to serve the Pittsfield community today. This collection contains
        administrative and vital records for the church and includes vital member records as well as
        church meeting minutes and ministerial records. The collection also contains ministerial
        records relating to the last decades of Thomas Allen's pastorate, including records related
        to the political schism of the church.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The First Church of Christ in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, was first organized in February
        1764. Construction on the first meeting house was begun in 1761 but work was not completed
        until 1770. Thomas Allen was called to be the first minister of the church and he was
        ordained as pastor on April 18, 1764. Planning for a second meeting house began in 1789 in
        order to meet the needs of the growing congregation and construction was completed in
        1793.</p>
      <p>Thomas "Parson" Allen was also called the "Fighting Parson" and was well remembered for his
        strong support for the American Revolution. He was said to carry his musket into his pulpit
        and was supposed to have fired the first shot against the British at the Battle of
        Bennington. Thomas Allen also had strongly held political beliefs. During the American
        Revolution, Allen was very anti-loyalist and following the American Revolution Allen's
        political beliefs became anti-federalist. This led to a schism within his church along
        political lines during the last years of his ministry; Allen even offered to resign in 1809
        over the schism though ultimately poor health and eventually his death in 1810 meant that
        his resignation was never accepted. From this schism the Second Union Church of Pittsfield
        was formed by Federalists in 1809.</p>
      <p>Thomas Allen's son, William Allen took over the pastorate of the First Church of Christ
        following his father's death. By 1816, there was talk of reuniting the First Church of
        Christ and the Second Union Church and in 1818 both were reunited under the pastorate of Dr.
        Heman Humphrey. Under Humphrey the Pittsfield Sabbath School Association was formed which
        included Congregationalists, Methodists, and Baptists. Humphrey resigned from the pastorate
        in 1823 to become the president of Amherst College. In 1846, black members of the First
        Church of Christ withdrew to form the Second Congregational Church. In 1850 another group of
        members withdrew to form the South Congregational Church.</p>
      <p>During the ministry of John Todd, on February 9, 1851, the second meeting house was
        partially destroyed by a fire. Construction on the third meeting house, which was designed
        to be a stone building, began in May 1852 and was completed on July 1853. A parish house and
        chapel was added to the building between 1868 and 1870. This was renovated and expanded in
        1893. In 1899, the French Church in Pittsfield was established with members meeting at the
        third meeting house and the Italian Church was likewise established not long after in 1908.
        The First Church of Christ became the first Congregational church in the United States, in
        1907, to join the home missions movement on its own by sponsoring T. S. Whitey and his work
        in Wyoming. In 1952, the whole church was renovated; that same year the church and parish
        were incorporated as a single entity. Three years later, in 1955, the French and Italian
        churches formally merged with the First Church of Christ.</p>
      <p>The First Church of Christ in Pittsfield continues to serve the community to this day.</p>
