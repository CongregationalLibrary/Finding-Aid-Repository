      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The First Church of Christ, in Berkley, Massachusetts, was gathered in 1737. The town of
        Berkley was incorporated in 1735 from an area of land that had belonged to the neighboring
        towns of Dighton and Taunton. The request to create a new town apparently came about in part
        due to dissatisfaction with the new pastor at the church in Taunton. Part of the conditions
        for the formation of the new town was that a new minister needed to be settled in the town
        within a two year period. In 1737, the town agreed to settle Samuel Tobey, a young graduate
        of Cambridge. His was a successful pastorate and he continued to serve the Congregational
        Church in Berkley until his death in 1781.</p>
      <p>For nearly seven years, a new minister to replace Tobey could not be found. Then, in 1788,
        Thomas Andros was settled in Berkley. Andros was largely a self-taught minister from
        Connecticut who had also fought in the American Revolutionary War and spent time as a
        prisoner of war in 1781. Under Andros, the name of the church changed to the Free Christian
        Church in 1814. Andros also had a long pastorate and served the church until his resignation
        in 1834 and he continued to be active in church life until his death in 1845.</p>
      <p>In part due to conflicts regarding the salary of the minister among other complaints, a
        group of church members separated from the Congregational Church in Berkley and formed the
        Trinitarian Congregational Church, also known as the Second Congregational Church in 1847.
        The first minister of this church was Rev. Mr. Eastman and he was followed by Rev. Mr.
        Roberts. In 1873, this church reformed as the Methodist Episcopal Church of Berkley.</p>
      <p>After the formation on the United Church of Christ in 1957, the Congregational Church in
        Berkley reorganized as the Berkley Congregational Church, UCC which continues to serve the
        local community today.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>The Berkley, Mass. Congregational Church records document the early history,
        administration, and life of the church and its members, as well as a major split that
        occured within the community. The collection includes financial records, church and parish
        records, including meeting minutes, committee reports, records of votes, sermons, and
        certificates of membership, disciplinary cases, and vital statistics, such as marriage and
        baptismal records. Also present in the collection are record books which relate to the
        Trinitarian Congregational Society, which split from the Congregational Society in 1848, and
        include narratives for why they split from the church as well as foundational documents for
        their new church society.</p>

          <p>There are two cases of church discipline, the first dating from May 4, 1799 and the
            second dating from April 6, 1814. The first is a letter written to Israel French, from
            Thomas Andros, suspending him from the church for stealing apples. The second is a
            deposition from the employer of Isaac Sanford in defense of his conduct while at work in
            Taunton.</p>
