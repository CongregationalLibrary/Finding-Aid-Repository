      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The village of Bradford was originally a part of Rowley and often was called "Rowley on the
        Merrimack" for its location along the Merrimack River. The name changed to Bradford when the
        town was incorporated on January 7, 1672. The first meeting house was erected two years
        prior to this in 1670, but because no church was officially established residents had to
        cross the river to Haverhill in order to receive communion. The first minister was Zechariah
        Symmes Jr. who had moved to the village for health reasons; he preached in the town for the
        14 years prior to the establishment of the first church. The First Church of Christ was
        established in 1682 and Symmes was immediately ordained as the first pastor. The first
        meeting house was replaced in 1706. In 1751 a third church building was constructed on the
        Bradford Common.</p>
      <p>The First Church of Christ in Bradford became the host for the 1810 General Association
        meeting. During this meeting clergy and students from the Andover Theological Seminary set
        forth a proposal which would shortly lead to the founding of the American Board of
        Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM). Two young women of the congregation, Ann Judson
        and Harriet Newell, were among the first missionaries sent out by the ABCFM. The third
        meeting house, having fallen into a state of disrepair and being too small for the
        congregation, was torn down and replaced by a fourth building in 1834. This church was
        replaced with the fifth, and final, meeting house in 1849. In 1850 the eastern portion of
        Bradford separated and was incorporated as the town of Groveland. In 1896, the towns of
        Haverhill and Bradford voted in favor of the annexation of Bradford into Haverhill, a
        process which was completed on January 1, 1897.</p>
      <p>The church organization was incorporated in 1901, and along with the adoption of a new
        covenant, the parish and proprietors organizations were dissolved. In 1915, the corporation
        was dissolved and administrative control was handed to the officers of the church. The First
        Church of Christ in Bradford continues to serve the community today.</p>
